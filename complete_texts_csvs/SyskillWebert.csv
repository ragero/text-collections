So, what more could you want? Now just click on to hear a taste of this great sound or to order your own copies.        Biographical Information:  In 1984 Lois LaFond had two of the most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, who were four and five years old. She searched high and low, in and out, up and down, by and through, far and wide, but couldn't find the kind of music she really liked made especially for Children (like smokin' saxophones and percolatin'percussion). So, being one to do whatever was necessary for those two most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, she decided to put out an album of her own with Reggae, Salsa, Blues,Ballads, Rock & Roll and African grooves. As she had been in the adult music scene for some number of years in the Boulder-Denver area, she had access to some of the greatest musicians to be found anywhere. And, as it worked out, in 1985, she had her third baby: I AM WHO I AM! This recording put her on the map as one of the premier American artists making modern music for young Children. At the same time she gathered four of Colorado's really rockin' players and formed LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES -- one of the early five-piece bands to hit the road for Kids.  Now this World Beat sound satisfied those two gorgeous, talented and astounding Children, who also composed many of the songs with LaFond. Soon LaFond found out that many other Children-- as well as their parents -- were absolutely thrilled with her recording. People said things like, ""I really don't mind that my Child plays this tape over and over and over and over and over and over. I really like it, too!"" Reviews poured in from all over the country from newspapers and magazines, parents and teachers, and -- most importantly -- from Kids. I AM WHO I AM! became a signature tune which put LaFond in the forefront of composing and producing songs of self-esteem and diversity -- years before they were the buzzwords of today. Classrooms started using the music, as did Spinabifida Centers, ARC Centers and Very Special Arts Festivals around the country.  Encouraged by the response, LaFond decided to make another record in 1986. And another one in 1987. And another one in 1989. Each recording brought more rave reviews, positive comments and responses from publications like THE L.A.PARENT, PARENTS' CHOICE, BILLBOARD MAGAZINE, DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE, GRAMMY MAGAZINE, American Library Association's BOOKLIST, PRE-K TODAY, MUSIC EDUCATOR'S JOURNAL, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL, Jill Jarnow's ALL EARS, Laurie Sale's GROWING UP WITH MUSIC .. . . In fact, there were so many reviews that there was no way to keep track of them anymore!  LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES' songs were played on RADIO AAHS, WE LIKE KIDS of KTOO, Alaska, PICKLEBERRY PIE out of Santa Cruz, WCBS-TV in New York, and on CONTINENTAL,LUFTHANSA, and DELTA Airlines Children's in-flight programming.  Of course, people started calling for shows with the ROCKADILES. So they toured their original participatory concerts to thousands of Children from New York to Oregon and from             Alaska to Florida at places like New York's CENTRAL PARK, HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT, and ST.PETER'S CATHEDRAL.  Then, in 1995, LaFond produced her fifth album, TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN. So now the Rockin' ROCKADILES' concerts include songs from this new recording as well as I AM WHO I AM! and their very popular ONE WORLD.  Soon LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES will be touring throughout COLORADO and in CHICAGO, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, and WASHINGTON, D.C. If you are in these areas, they might just be able to come to your community. You can call HEATHER NOTO at AGENCY WEST (303-652-3421) to bring ROCKADILES to YOUR town -- wherever you are!!  One thing Lois LaFond knows for sure is that every Child she gets to meet now is gorgeous, talented and astounding.   BAND MEMBER LIST:  LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES' live show paints a rainbow of words that kids love, messages that parents appreciate, and great music that pulls it all together in the World Beat.  Mother, singer, songwriter, producer, and speaker, LOIS LaFOND spent most of her life in the performance arts of dance, music, mime, and theatre, as well as teaching. Lois first made her mark in the adult world of music as vocalist and lyricist. She then brought her varied styles of music to the hearts of Children -- writing, producing, and recording five albums for Children and their families. Her sophisticated world music enjoys national acclaim from the L.A. PARENT and PARENTS' CHOICE to BILLBOARD and DOWNBEAT magazines. Her songs appear on several international airlines and commercial and promotional videos. Her spoken voice is heard on voice-overs for video and radio productions as well as commercials.

Her many years of experience in the disciplines of teaching, music, and the performing arts combine to create the ultimate in entertainment for the entire family.  THE PLAYERS:  Drummer GORDON KENNEDY has been a musical mainstay in the ROCKADILES. He is featured on all of LaFond's recordings and in her opinion, ""Gordon has everything: great rhythm, keen ears,and a wild sense of humour."" Kennedy started drumming on potato chip cans at 13. Now his styles range from rock to freeform improvisation with his current band, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. His drumming credits include, as he says, ""Too many bands to be significant."" He has opened for TALKING HEADS, THE RAMONES and KING SUNNY ADE. Kennedy says, ""With Children, there are no pretensions. It's just plain fun to work with THE ROCKADILES.""  Keyboardist REBECCA MARTIN began playing the piano at the age of six,and went on to earn a B.A. in Music and a Masters in Piano Performance and Pedagogy. Her talent for improvisation is seen in her jazz combo, THE REBECCA MARTIN TRIO, and the big band PANDAEMONIUM. She is an outstanding classical pianist who performs both solo and duet. She has taught piano for 21 years, specializing in the Suzuki method for young Children. Rebecca composed the piano music on LaFond's third tape SOMETHING NEW!  Bassist CHICO MEIRA also plays guitar, sings and composes. He began studying guitar as an eight year old child in Rio de Janeiro. The traditional music of Brazil which he brings to the band encompasses Samba, Bossa Nova, Chorinho, and African as well as Brazilian rhythms. He played in many rock bands in his native country and was the major force behind the band PAO BRASIL providing both classical guitar and vocals. Currently, in addition to ROCKADILES, he plays bass and percussion with CONGUEROS DEL ALMA while working as a full time bio-engineer.  Saxophonist MARK HARRIS has played everything from what he calls ""way-avante-honk-and- squeak music"" to the Colorado Symphony. Whatever the style, his preference is to play original music. His favorite style is world beat dance music with his band, MONKEY SIREN. Mark has played for shows with Bob Hope, Joe Williams, The Temptations, and Diane Schuur. He teaches sax at Metro State College of Denver and has appeared as a featured classical soloist with their wind ensemble. He performs on many recordings including those of Ron Miles, Fred Hess, and Janet Feder. He says, ""Kids are swell.""

I just started thinking of the craziest combinations of words that started with the same letter. I like to pass on to kids some of what are called ""figures of speech"" in the English language, and this one is always a lot of fun. You can make up your own alliterations -- try any letter.  ""One World"" originated as a song for adult audiences. Its groove has an mbaganga influence from South Africa, also called ""township jive."" When recording my Children's album, I thought ""One World"" would be a great choice to include for kids since it always got a such a hearty response from dancing adults. I try not to do any less for kids than I do for adults.   Press Reviews   About TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (song included online):   P.J.

Merchandise Description:  TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (LL-05c and LL-05cd) (Song ""Alliteration Sensation"" included online)  In this hot new release, LaFond does turn it all upside down. Continuing in her tradition of cutting edge music, this new album replaces her big band sound with the essentials of music: vocals and percussion. LaFond has turned to an exciting array of over 40 percussion instruments from around the world including the Australian Didgeridoo, the Brazilian Berimbau and the American Washboard -- and everything in between. Singing of everything from numbers in three languages to a changeable creature named Zuppie, this recording also includes a parade, movement songs and a 5-minute relaxation process.  PLUS, based on LaFond's highly successful workshop: ""USING MUSIC IN THE CLASSROOM: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BEETHOVEN,"" she has compiled a manual of hands-on ideas for Parents and Teachers to use the songs to teach all the disciplines including Language, Math, Art, Imagination, and more. Hailed by teachers and parents and, especially, kids. Geared for the Child 4-7.  Songlist:   Celebrate! Alliteration Sensation Stop & Go Numbers All Around!

Blooz in Zb Anyway I Can Palmas Turn Around    ONE WORLD (LL-04) (Available on CD for radio play or demo; soon to be publicly released on CD)(Song ""One World"" included online)  Danceable, singable WORLD BEAT MUSIC for Children of all ages, this album was the first of its kind in the Children's market. Before Paul Simon's GRACELAND was released, the Rockadiles were writing Afro-Pop songs for the highly successful Denver dance band for adults, ORCHESTRA KING MAMA. This sound is captured on ONE WORLD, which includes African/Caribbean-influenced music styles such as soca and mbaganga, as well as blues, gospel, jazz, klezmer,reggae, and ballads. Geared for the Child of all ages. This percolating music will get the whole family moving and singing together from the first tune!  Songlist:   Part of the Family I Lost My Shoes Some Days Are Happier Than Others Smile Wascawy Wabbit You Can Be Whatever You Want To Be You Can Dance Raining Cats & Dogs Bokey In Control The Night Rides In On Ships One World    I AM WHO I AM! (LL-01)  The title song ""I Am Who I Am!"" remains one of LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES' signature tunes. This is an exceptional collection of 13 original songs in a variety of modern styles of music, including Reggae, Salsa, Rock & Roll, Blues, Ballads, and more. The songs emphasize movement, language, rhythm and ""just plain fun."" Applauded for their sophistication, this is music with a message to boot. With her eye always on self-esteem and diversity, LaFond includes two songs in French and Spanish. Child-oriented topics include ME!, animals, colors, space, and much much more. Geared for the Child 2-7.  Songlist:   I Am Who I Am! Space is Going To Be Fun Up in the Sky Where the Whales Are Rainbows My Room The Beat Couldn't Do It A Year Ago (But I Can Do It Now) Dinosaurs Boo Hoo Pengo & Poley Colors/Colores Living Things Rock & Roll    SOMETHING NEW! (LL-03)  An unusually beautiful collection of lullabies and soothing music for the newborn baby, with the additional benefit of relaxing Children and adults of all ages, this recording explores the richness of the voice as well as acoustic instrumentation. LaFond includes a Sioux Indian chant and a 19th century Scottish lullaby. Side Two features ""HeartRhythms"": the calming sound of the Mother's heartbeat enhanced with gentle percussion sounds. Recommended for naptime, bedtime, as a classroom cool-down or following a tiring day.

Penelope was heralded as the ""archetypal indomitable rock 'n' roll woman and her band dubbed ""a major national musical asset"" by The New Touser Press Record Guide .  Time matured her music; hard-edged noise became intricate melody, and raw anger became transformed into a bittersweet awareness of the human condition. Penelope was drawn to the evocative and immediate nature of acoustic instruments. In expanding the dimensions of her core sound, she added bandoneon, cello, accordion, soprano and bass clarinet, cornet, French horn, melodica and autoharp. Her work has evolved in terms of intimacy and depth of emotion, but she has lost none of the fierce intelligence that powered the music of the Avengers.

""This crazy chick should turn VH-1 on its ear."" -- The Music Paper    Mary Ellen Bernard just doesn't know how to fit in. Her debut recording  Point of Departure  was described by a New York radio personality as ""Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman."" (Huh?) See, it's not quite pop, not quite jazz, not quite blues, not quite folk -- and yet, a little of each. And some of it's kind of, well ... funny. What's a radio programmer to do? Well ... play it! And they have ... at WXPN in Philadelphia ... WGBH in Boston ... the ""Z-100 Morning Zoo"" in New York city ... KSER in Seattle... even Radio Riga in Latvia! (Yes, Latvia.) And listeners love it.  On Point of Departure Mary Ellen and producer Paul Guzzone are more musically extravagant than is currently feasible in her live shows. Here, the Patty Larkin song ""Caffeine"" is a full-fledged big-band number. Other tracks feature (live, not sampled) Brazilian percussion, horn sections, even bird calls. (Okay, the bird calls are sampled -- with permission, of course.) ""We tried desperately to use every musician in New York,"" Mary Ellen says of the undertaking. ""We didn't, but you still get your money's worth.""  Mary Ellen has been playing live at such Northeast clubs as The Iron Horse Music Hall in Northampton, MA; The Godfrey Daniels in Bethlehem, PA; The Bitter End in New York city, The Towne Crier in Pawling, NY and other folk clubs, coffee houses, jazz & blues rooms, theaters and festivals. She's opened shows for Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, John Sebastian and Saffire: Uppity Blues Women.  Backed by keyboards and bass/acoustic guitar (and sometimes violin), her concerts center mostly on rootsy blues and jazz, bittersweet ballads and her signature ""wacky production numbers."" ""Caffeine"" has become one of these and so has the John Prine/Fred Koller collaboration ""Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian."" Recently some original tunes have entered this category as well. ""My mission is to disprove the theory that no one ever laughs in a folk club,"" she states. ""I'll be working on jazz clubs next.""  Order NOW!

We are a neo-retro band, playing both original music and covers. The song loaded onto the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) is ""Get Even More,"" our personal advice for when things go bad: Don't get mad, don't get even, get even more!  Deth Specula was formed by the crafty Malcom McCameron a couple of years ago, and was an immediate hit with some of the band's friends. Deth Specula is:    Kozmo - rhythm guitar, vocals  Malcom McCameron - lead guitar, management  Tim E Rotarian (aka Timmy, aka Timmer) - lead vocals  RaSTrO! - drums  Yam - bass, vocals  Immediately after forming the band, Malcom booked the group on a series of World Tours. It seemed like a good idea at the time. However, by sheer coincidence, every single gig they tried to play, such as Kuwait City in January of 1991, or Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines, was canceled due to some kind of natural or human-caused disaster. Recently, Malcom vainly tried to put together a Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour following the latest United Nations declarations, but again war intervened and the tour was cancelled.  Because of the Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour debacle, Deth Specula has many concert t-shirts left over, most of which are stored in Malcom's dad's garage.

ABOUT THE DEMO SONG Get Even More :  Get Even More is for anyone who gets screwed over by Fate, The System, a lover, your boss, or whatever. We have always considered it a special song because members of Deth Specula, many of our fans, and close friends lost their jobs over the last couple of years.  The song was recorded at the drummer's house on a Tascam 8-track cassette. Vocals (Timmy, Yam and Kozmo) were recorded on the back porch and the guitars (Malcom and Kozmo) were recorded in the bathroom. Drums (RaStRo!) were recorded in the bedroom and the bass (Yam) was direct. Although it was mastered on cassette (oh joy), the end result is not too shabby. However, we can't wait to rerecord this in a studio.  Engineering was handled by Eric ""Sharky"" Davis, the Mystery Sixth Member of the band. Sharky takes care of our live sound, much of our recording, camera work, and general technical stuff. We couldn't have done it without him.  Get Even More is one of our most popular live songs (along with our cover of ""Radar Love"" and our original ""(I'm in Love with a) Gutterslut."" We play it just as well live as on tape, in case you were wondering. :-)   by Robert Lord of the IUMA staff            December 29, 1993   I Wanna Be Updated is Deth Specula's bonus song for the IUMA. It's a spoof on the Ramones song I Wanna Be Sedated to reflect what it's like to working for a software company. Here'some lyrics for example:   Twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours to go,   I wanna be updated.  Nothing to do, nowhere to go,   I wanna be updated.   Get me to the trade show,   put me on a plane.  Send it to me Fed Ex,  before I go insane.  I can't control my budget,  can't drink away the pain,  Oh no no no no!   These guys are a tight rock band and this song rules.

Box 170331    San Francisco, California 94117 USA  fax: (415) 885.6091   e-mail: dj.miscreant@sfnet.com   Legal: Jeff LaFave, Esq. Thorsnes, Bartolotta, McGuire & Padilla Fifth Ave. Financial Center, 11th Floor 2550 Fifth Avenue San Diego, CA 92103  Excerpted from an interview with Ms. Karen Eliot, editor of BULLET TRAIN :  When and where did the band coalesce?    Hungry Ghost began in 1937 near Brussels, but the band really began creating in earnest about a year ago. Our home base is San Francisco, but Ulbrecht recently moved to Moscow for a two-year stint posing as an American attorney. Bhopal coordinates his efforts from San Diego, California because he likes to surf with the sharks.  How would you describe the music?   We consider our stuff pretty diverse. We strive to create ambient soundscapes and sound collages with an ethnic-industrial twist.  How does the band create the music?   We do a lot of free forming. Most times we start with sound clips taken from the urban environment that surrounds us and then mush 'em together with guitars, percussion, samplers and synthesizers. A lot of times we do long, improvisational jam sessions and take out short clips for further manipulation.  	Other times, we have a particular mood or idea in mind and create songs around this concept with whatever sound is handy at the time.  	We work well together; everyone has a finger in the creation of a song.  Where do you do your creating?   We have our own studio, called DS2 (Death of a Supermodel or 2) here in San Francisco. It's clean and warm and has everything we require. The digital age has made us self-sufficient in our creative efforts.  Do you have any recordings available yet?   We have two jukebox 45s floating around. One is a single with two cuts:  ""Maimana Casque"" and ""Quechua Click.""  Recently, we cut a joint single with friends from Portland, Oregon. Our cut is called ""Miles.""  On the flip side is a band called Compost .  	Around August 1994, we'll be releasing our first CD, which is entitled  ""Brownout at the Spectacle.""           These items are available through our label, Galivant Media in San Francisco. You can mail order all of it.  Any other projects in the works?  	Yeah . . . We have some videos in the works. We've been shooting a lot of Super 8mm film, which is a truly wonderful medium. Very grainy and great texture; quite a contrast to the sterility of most other formats. When a song gives us particular inspiration, we create some visual images to accompany it. We're planning on distributing the videos through Galivant Media, and we have plans to air the videos on OFFLINE , which is a public access program distributed on networks around the United States.  We're working on a soundtrack for a public access film about graffiti art in subway tunnels. It's in the works...  We're also working with multimedia artists who produce CD-ROMs. The group is called Cafe-E, and they're in New York. We provide them with ""content,"" as it's called in the venacular.  Do you have any plans to tour?   Not as yet, but we're not averse to live gigs. We want to wait until there is sufficient interest in our music before we venture forth from the comfortable confines of DS2. When we do decide to tour, we'd like to start in Europe. That way we can tour and vacation at the same time. We feel no pressure though.  Is there any political bent in the music?   Just the usual smash the State stuff. We don't use lyrics as such, so the sound textures are more open to interpretation than the straight narrative stuff in most music. This drives some people crazy, but we expect each listener to interpret the soundscapes in their own way based on what they're thinking or feeling at the time.  We definitely have our own political agendas, but they aren't essential to our musical agendas.            ",Bands

I give God all the glory for my inspiration and I am sure there are many that claim inspiration, but the Book of James says that every good and perfect gift comes from the Father, and what perfection there is in my music is a gift from the God of the United States. It usually takes me between 10 and 20 minutes to write a song, usually less, and I rarely have corrections to make, only minor ones, a conjunction or the like. I am 55 this July, should the Lord let me continue to live, and am co-owner in a dental laboratory with my husband. I have run for office three times, holding up the principes of free enterprise which made this nation great and which will explain my concern for a real market, I am founder of a publishing company and missionary society, again in conjunction with my wonderful husband and am an ordained minister of the gospel. I have a daughter and a son, two step-daughters and beloved grandchildren. I have dedicated my life to rebuilding America with a special dedication and burden of bringing glory to my forefathers of God's music. I have written over 200 songs and poems, but find that the stronghold of merchandising control makes it nearly impossible to promote any music beyond what is according to someone's preplanned agenda. The old saying says, ""Let me write the music of the nation, and I care not who writes the laws."" I will continue to write and trust God to punish thieves and make them pay back fourfold, in this life, as well as in eternity.    Sincerely - for Christ,     June Griffin             ",Bands

Since hls early teens, Josh has had a dream to conquer the realms of musicology. From writirig song lyrics, to composing music to fit them to, Josh was never told he  couldn't do it. In his twenty-one years he has reveled to the heights of his dream, mastering the art of playing several musical instruments, writing heart rendering lyrics, and arranging music that wlll set  the hardest soul to dancing. To make the cycle complete, Josh has delved into the other side of the board and become a prolific producer as well. With two completed albums, 'Lifetimes' (Rock alternative) with his 'Nowhere Dreamer' band, and as a Soloist on the album 'Venus Butterfly' -'Tao of lust', (Techno  Dance,) Josh Mottley, and long time friend Doug Robertson have brought Adult Comedy Rap to the list of his ever growing repertoire of original productions wlth their newest endeavor, ' NASTY WABBIT .' Although the  finishing touches have yet to be put on this humorous demo, the two have gotten off to a great start wlth 'Naked Naked' and 'Fire In The Hole.'  Doug Robertsom affectionately known as 'The Party Animal'  by Josh and their friends, was born and raised In Grand Rapids, Michigan on January the  8th. 1971. Doug played Soccer for East Grand Rapids High, and was on the All State Conference  team in high school. In 1990 Doug relocated to Scottsdale. Arizona where he met Josh when his brother  Don, joined the 'Nowhere Dreamer Band' led by Mottley.  Doug, the ""cut up,"" always making the others laugh with his raw humor and original Rapping lyrics caught the ear of Mottley. Josh, being ever on the look  out for something unique musically to conquer, recognized Doug's talent and teamed with Robertson to bring life to the down home humor of the guy from Grand Rapids.  Mottley, by now an old pro to the music industry, took 'Rappin' Doug' Into the studio to produce his first encounter into the music field. Doug took to the microphone like a duck takes to water. Before all the scratch vocals were laid for the music, Doug could  be heard through the speakers calling to the engineer, 'Hey Rog, roll the damn tape.'  Doug has completed the first two songs on the demo  under the dlrection of Mottley who wrote and arranged the music and also sang the back ground parts of the songs, 'Naked Naked' and 'Fire In The Hole;' both of which were lyrically written by Robertson. When ask where he gets hls rapping talent Doug kindly replies, 'I'm a black man living in a white mans body.'      While waiting to complete the 'Nasty Wabbit' album, Doug can be found working as a waiter in a local Scottsdale restaurant. When not working or  rappin', Doug attends Scottsdale Community College, where he is majoring in Business Administration. Doug has a great sense of humor behind the microphone, and with the combined talents of both mem they are sure to take 'NASTY WABBIT' to the upper reaches of musical acclaim.            ",Bands

After three independent releases on the Figurehead label, he felt that it was time to focus on writing lyrics and music that was a little more raw and a little less serious than what Braille Closet was doing.   In early 1993, Bill started the Canned Corn label. The first release in Spring of 1993 was Redbug's ""Blue Light Special"" b/w ""Downtown"" 7-inch. The single received good airplay in a few markets and none in a lot. Redbug played a few shows with various members: drummer Brian Maguire (currently with Jacksonville's Dave Ronan and the Hootowls) and bassist Andrew Dalio (also of Disco Biscuit). Blair had been working on a solo project and was recruited to sing on the record and play bass on a mini-tour since Andrew's other band keeps him real busy.  The session for the current album, ""No Muffins For Shadow!,"" started as a session for another 7-inch. Engineer Mark Ignoffo had worked with Smashing Pumpkins in their early days, and the band was impressed with a lot of the music coming out of his studio, Reel Time. Mark didn't know what to think of Redbug at first. The band didn't care. They just wanted to take advantage of his 20 hours for $500.00 special. Two of the songs on the album, ""Hush Puppy"" and ""Steely Cowsdell,"" were improvisational jams that ended up on the record. Also included on the C.D. are wacky versions of Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"" and Pearl Jam's ""Black."" ""Blue Light Special"" and ""Downtown"" were remixed and included on the disc also. ""Astro-Manta-Ray"" is a tribute to one of the band's faves, Man or Astro-Man. The song ""Funky Nassau"" available here is a eulogy to our now defunct bowling league, Crush Crush Crush.   Redbug's music was described in Minneapolis' YOUR FLESH as ""proficient country-dork spoo."" Charlotte's THE INDIE FILE described them as ""They Might Be Giants with some real talent."" The bands influences range from The Outlaws and Buck Owens to the B-52's and X. They prefer not to be categorized, but if need be, call 'em cow-dork-punk.

Active in the San Francisco music scene since the post-punk explosion of the mid-80's, both Rayburn and bassist Sally Engelfried comprised two-thirds of the folk-punk band Yo, who delighted audiences with their three independently released albums on Deadbeat and Enigma Records.  Band member Christine Wall brings to the band sweet-tinged vocal harmonies which made her contributions to the last two Chris Isaak records (including the hit ""Wicked Game"") so memorable.  Violinist John Tenney is a veteran of stage and record whose solid musicianship has been appreciated by the likes of XTC, Van Morrison, and Frank Sinatra, with whom he has played.

OTHER INFO (because we don't have any press reviews!)   El Sob...and Stuff  Folk-roots rockers El Sob coined the term ""Stuff Band"" to describe themselves because ""we're not afraid to play anything that might come our way while shopping at Thrift Town,"" says Christine Wall, who has been known to balance a cowbell, a glass of water for gargling, and a dog toy during the course of one song. 	""I used to play a regular electric bass,"" adds Sally Engelfried, ""but I found it too limiting, so in searching for the right sound I had one made for me."" The resulting one-of-a-kind instrument is striking in its piano-like resonance. ""I'm devoted to El Sob because this is the only band that lets me shake my tookus in public,"" comments John Tenney, who sometimes takes a turn at tambourine and kazoo, in addition to his specialties of violin and mandolin.

I think my music is unique because although I'd like a career in music, that is not my motivation. Making music is very spiritual and songs are like prayers for me. My songs are always analytical, sometimes topical and occasionally political because I want the listeners to get emotional about, think about or get angry about a subject they were previously unfamiliar with. I think a good song can get under your skin and bring up emotions you never knew were there.

One guitar magazine called him the ""Guitar Hero of the Nineties""!. Lucky Me! He played on my song!!   Dave Ambrosio - Bass: A very talented virtuoso musician. Dave has a degree in composition from Manhattan School of Music and is playing with a Jazz band in Manhattan. He can also play keyboards and has played guitar on some of my songwriting demos.   Paul Presseau - Drums: Another virtuoso musician. He can also play piano and guitar and writes beautiful lyrics. He likes to travel and study music of different cultures.

The idea was to make my voice not only sing the lyrics but also sound like a guitar. Then for the guitar to tell the rest of the story when I stopped singing the lyrics. I'm very proud of this production because it's the first record I produced that sounds exactly the way I wanted it to sound. I also incorporated elements of ""Hey Joe"" and other Hendrix riffs into this song.  America:  I wanted this to sound like it's coming from the point of view of a Native American which is why I used tribal drum sounds. This is combined with military marching band sounds because the song is about how greed, power and the desire for world domination can destroy a beautiful country. The intro and outro are excerpts of Gospel singer Marion Williams' ""They Lead my Lord Away"".

The spoken word lyrics are somewhere between poetry and song lyrics: there are repeated elements as there would be in lyrics, but not bound by the verse/chorus format. As the material is not read as a poem would be, but spoken, the intent is for the listener to be able to take away something of what was heard, much as being able to remember a song's melody. In a creative blitz, 15 songs have been written and recorded from September of 1993 to today. KFJC, the radio station at 89.7 FM, is playing material from the demo tapes. Other radio stations are in the works.    Member Bios:   Tom Aragon  -Keyboards and Guitar  Tom has independently released Ascension, a collection of ambient musicla testures in the electronic/acoustic vein through his project, The Temple of Sound.

Formerly, Tom was guitar and keyboard player in the rock group The X-Factor. With various bands, he has opened for such name groups as Y&T, Foghart, John Lee Hooker, and Cold Blood.

You're in an opium den in England. It's dark, smoky and red hued: Blood red walls, dark red tapestries on the floor, red velvet sofas along the walls. Whether it's the smoke or the effect of the smoke on your mind, it's hard to tell real from illusion, pysical from imagined.

If you ask most female songwriters who their main influence has been, 90% of them will name Joni Mitchell. Ask Eileen the same question and she doesn't hesitate. ""Dr. Seuss,"" she replies. This is not your average folksinger.  Eileen got her start performing in comedy clubs in California. Although she did well in competitions, she wanted to emphasize her music as much as her humor, something that is not possible in the cut-throat world of stand-up comedy.  When she moved east, Eileen concentrated on the music scene, quickly becoming a regular performer at folk festivals and coffeehouses. In addition to the humorous songs she brought with her, she began to write satirical songs about the culture shock of living in Washington, D.C., after growing up in California.

No Winter was born in the Fall of 1979 in Aptos, California as a quartet. After stormy beginnings, the dust cleared and a tight, enduring trio (Robert, Jim and Dave) emerged called AURORA BOREALIS. Early original music had wide influences and took shape in arrangements which balanced song with intricate instrumental passages. As the band began to perform, numerous cover tunes crossing most musical boundaries (From Alabamas to Zeppelins) were added to the repertoire. This helped to keep a ride range of rooms filled, dancing, happy and intact. Always between the covers lurked the original songs.  Throughout the years the band evolved, mutated, went into oblivion and returned from oblivion, leading to the current project - an eight song CD/Cassette. This was produced with two living in Northern California and the other in Southern California. Three of these songs are showcased here and the others are:        Haven't I Cried Enough      Queen of the Rodeo   In Heaven  I need some Lovin'  Message to the stars  No Winter perpetually looks for musical/recording/exposure/performance opportunities.

The pair, who met when the poles of their portable IV's of  Maintainizine collided on their way  to  shock  treatment  therapy, apparently were left to their own comedic devices when the TV broke in the day room last week.  ""I've listened to the CD and have concluded that Frau Lee and Herr Sea are too sick for this facility,"" said Chief  of Psychiatry, Dr. Sy Cotic.   ""I'd  mistakenly thought there  was hope for full recovery when they no longer insisted upon coming to meals with their gowns open in the front, but when they didn't respond to occupational therapy and got on this joke jag, I had to let them go.    We simply cannot tolerate  patients  wasting valuable materials to make hand buzzers and fake barf,"" Dr. Cotic continued.  Although unavailable for comment, ""Lee and Sea  vehemently deny having made the CD while on the inside,"" an unidentified spokesman said.   ""Actually, one day they were so bored,  they escaped, unnoticed, and ended-up at a nearby  grange  hall  in Chimacum, Washington where they happened upon a bunch of other former patients who were attempting to improvise eco-based comedy bits for Seattle area radio station, KSER. Trying to turn topics as grim as acid rain dripping through holes in the ozone into knee slapping comedy, appealed to the two depressives right away. When Sea's old Radio Shack dictation machine caught fire,"" the spokesman continued, ""the other inmates fled.  But Lee and Sea stuck it out and deeply inhaled the toxic fumes which became the streams of acerbic exhalations that ultimately led to the creation of Mouthbreather.  With no hope of obtaining corporate financing, the desperate pair pooled their disability checks and held hostage an innocent sound engineer who did an award winning job of mixing an entire album with the jagged edge of a broken IV bottle at his throat.  The result is seventy-two minutes of incisive, synapse blistering humor. Mouthbreather: Humor for the Totally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes . On CD and Cassette.

ISIKOJAM was formed while Kirk Casey, Soul Maah, and Maanas Itene were backing various South African and reggae artists in the San Francisco Bay Area. Kirk brought keyboardist Jonathan Ridpath to the group, and after one night of playing that was it! ""It felt as though we had been playing together for years.""  ISIKOJAM combines many styles of music and fuses them together to produce music that is very groove oriented with distinct melodies.   BASS:  Simon (Soul) Maah from Cameroon played with EKAMBI Brilliant and Manu Dibango, The Soul Makossa Man. Soul left Cameroon for Nigeria to play with Jerry Cooper. He then embarked on a thirteen year recording and producing career that took him to such world class studios as EMI, DECCA, Phonodisk, RecordDisk, Satellite, and TABANSI. After touring with Sonny Okusons for five years, Soul came to the United States looking for new challenges. Residing in the East Bay, Soul plays for many international and local artists that make their way through the Bay Area.   GUITARS: Kirk Casey was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a young teenager his band opened shows for The Grateful Dead, Santana, and The Sons Of Champlin. Studying composition in college, Kirk then continued with Cuban Classical guitar. Kirk's interest in world music and jazz lead him to study music from many countries of the world. He then studied with Miles Davis guitarist Dave Cramer. Currently, Kirk can be heard on many national television commercials for such Fortune 500 companies as Alamo Car rental, Toyota, GMC trucks, Buick,Yamaha motorcycles, and the NBA. Kirk also tours internationally with Jamaican artists Della Grant and The Twinkle Brothers.   DRUMS: Maanas Itene hails from Nigeria, West Africa. It took Maanas three years to get to the United States to seek his fortune as a respected musician. Upon arrival to the United States the tour previously scheduled for the band was canceled. Maanas found himself without work and stranded. He made his way to the Bay Area, and now tours with KOTOJA, West African High Life Band, and Inka Inka. Groups that Maanas has formerly played with in Nigeria include Liberty Loverboy, Victor Suuku, Isaac Black, King Walla Man, and Mandators.   KEYBOARDS:  Jonathan Ridpath has been playing for over thirty years. He studied at the Berklee School of Music and the New England Conservatory. After his schooling, Jonathan then toured along the East Coast, and has played at Tanglewood on several occasions. Jonathan moved to San Francisco in 1976 and began teaching classical piano. Jonathan recently released a solo EP, titled Reflections.  For information about ISIKOJAM please contact:   ISIKOJAM MUSIC P.O.

Then the lyrics are repeated with AWESOME music. We repeat the Spanish and English words and phrases up to 4 times for the longer phrases.  YOU DO NOT GET BORED because your mind fixates on the music and you pick up the Spanish the way you pick up words to your favorite song.  YOUR MIND BECOMES BILINGUAL.   The Result  You may be in a Spanish Restaurant and hear ""Disculpame."" Right away you think ""Excuse Me."" It becomes automatic. You actually think in English but speak in Spanish (in the beginning.)  History of RAPANESE  Rapanese was created by a Canadian, ex-disc jockey, school teacher, Mike D'Amours.

""Four stars out of three!""  - James Velvet, WPLR Local Bands Show  ""This highly proficient quartet... plays darn well!""  - Christopher Arnott, New Haven Advocate   What the Cat Dragged In is an unsigned and flat broke band of Yale graduate students. Originally formed in late 1992, the band has played numerous clubs in the New Haven area as well as the annual Summertime Street Festival. The band's instrumentation includes (but is not limited to) guitar, keyboards, bass and drums.  On Nov. 5, 1994, the band released its first full-length CD, Scratch Tracks . This entirely independent release was co-produced with Jim Chapdelaine (Mr. Right). The CD contains 12 tracks for a total running time of 54:02 and includes an 8 panel full-color insert with lyrics, pictures, and graphics.  Big Love is the first track off the CD to receive air time.  All of us take turns at lead vocal which adds alot of variety to our music. Additionally, we each come to the band from different musical backgrounds, so our music moves through the entire spectrum of genres. The above song was chosen for distribution through IUMA because we feel it represents an intriguing combination of our musical interests.    Heather Nye : Keyboards, Percussion Heather is a native of Vancouver, WA, a Duke alum, a fourth year  pharmacology major, and a first year med student.  She plays an Ensoniq KS-32 and a Yamaha DX-7. Her influences are jazz/pop oriented and include Bonnie Raitt, Maria McKee, David Wilcox, and David Sandborn.   Mark Cassano : Guitar Mark is our resident guitar hero. He's a native of Danbury, CT and an NYU grad. Currently, he's finishing his degree in Economics while posing as a mild-mannered professor at Vassar. He plays a Hamer Special (made back in the days when Hamer was still a designer in the company) and thinks Richard Thompson is the greatest guitar player alive (but still listens to just about everything else.)    Marco Mazzi : Drums Marco still lives in New London, CT, his hometown for life, and makes the hour long drive for practices, shows, and classes. An RPI grad, he's studying electrical engineering. Marco plays Slingerland drums, is a big time Marillion fan, and knows a few guys named Vinny.    John McEachen : Bass, Harmonica, Guitar John hails from Woodbridge, VA and is also an electrical engineering major. A Notre Dame alum, he can consistently be found in front of the TV on Saturday afternoons. John plays a 6-string Alembic Elan. A former member of the defunct bluegrass combo Whistler's Brother , he has some pretty hefty country/folk persuasions.            ",Bands

Singer, songwriter, arranger and performer, Eve B. , has been performing in the Boston area since 1990 when she formed and fronted the band, Eve'n Up. The band played Eve's original tunes in Boston clubs for three years headlining and opening for other area locals before Eve decided to go solo in 1993.  Eve's musical past also includes the recording of a single on an independent European label in 1988, tours of Japan and France in 1988 and 1989, and more recently, performances with The Berklee College of Music Gospel Choir as a soloist in 1993.  Among Eve's various musical projects are several self-produced demos. The most recent, a four-song CD entitled, Innocence, is the culmination of her performing and songwriting experience. The four songs on the CD were written, produced and arranged by Eve B. with assistance from songwriter/ guitarist, Andrea Bensmiller, who previously performed in the Boston acoustic scene. Eve and Andrea merged their talents in 1994 to form EB Productions and have since continued to write, arrange and produce together.    The four tracks included on Innocence are ""Sexy Thing"", ""Innocence"", ""Invitation"", and ""Field of Hope"". Each tune showcases Eve's soulful, sultry, and purely original vocal style. Eve's creative and tasteful integration of vocal riffs and runs makes each tune breathe with soul and originality. The songs can best be described as a blend of pop and R&B with a strong gospel influence. Arrangements are characterized by the complex interweaving of keyboards and guitars, and lush harmonic backing vocals.

59,"   Distant Cousins                         Distant Cousins         Elvis Did Karate              (Excerpt 120k, 120k / Full song 2.5 mins, 2.02M, 2.70M)     College/Indie/Lo-Fi ,  Pop             Only rarely does one come upon a distant relative that at once becomes a familiar friend, possessing shared secrets that never cease to beguile. Such is the case of Twice Removed , the astonishingly mature debut from New York's distant cousins . Like their moniker, distant cousins are lower case in an upper-case world, a unique school of fish ready to burst out of a big pond with the eclectic bag of tricks they display on Twice Removed .  First of all, these cousins are slyly deceptive. While the playful cover art and buoyant, rambling rhythms first suggest a party band, on closer inspection Twice Removed 's songs have dark roots that add depth to their danceability. The album's opener, the raucous ""Elvis Did Karate"" is a camp classic, but singer/songwriter/guitarist Catherine Dail 's husky wail imparts a simmering sensuality that's more Chrissie Hynde than downtown dilettante. And ""Gotta Fly,"" opening with awkward, tentative bass notes reminiscent of Talking Head's ""Psycho Killer,"" turns into a Beatlesque rocker that details the ups and downs of an obsessive relationship that refuses to end. Even ""Tambourine Girl"" a seemingly innocuous song propelled by bright vocals and upbeat island riddims , describes a lovable misfit unable to fit in, who ""does not play the tuba, no no, because it weighs too much/And when it comes to guitar playin' that girl ain't got the touch.""  Where distant cousins truly impress is their effortless ability to shift between many musical styles, often within the same song. Twice Removed ranges from the chicken-scratch guitar and blue-eyed soul of ""Pony"" (where Dail strongly tells her lover ""don't ride me baby, I'm not your pony"") to sophisticated, jazzy pop like the smoky ""Three Things"" and quietly longing ""Love's Here Now"" . distant cousins even manage to make having the ""Minnesota Blues"" sound like fun; combining a humorous confessional with bar-band boogie, ""Minnesota Blues"" suggests an unholy alliance between Laurie Anderson and the Spin Doctors.  Underscoring the masterful songwriting is distant cousins' familial musical virtuosity. On ""Elvis Did Karate"" lead guitarist Jon Diamond brings a hard, bluesy swagger to his soloing, then switches to a mariachi stroll on ""Burning Words."" As well, Joe ""Mama"" Holland 's harmonica provides a questioning counterpoint to the lyrics on ""No Exception"" and Fred Gildes' subtle trombone shadings on ""Pony"" suggest an indecision hiding behind Dail's outwardly tough stance. When necessary, distant cousins aren't afraid to bring in bongos, timbales, organ or piano to flesh out an already well-fed groove. And they're no strangers to technology, either - check out the off-kilter samples that ornament the otherworldly jam session ""Lucky Magnet.""   Recalling both the past and the future, distant cousins appear comfortable in their uncategorizable but homey place in-between the in-betweens. And from the sound of Twice Removed , these cousins won't be distant for long. Be sure to bring the family.     distant cousins' ""Twice Removed"" has really hit the college radio waves with great success across the country. The band has been on the road early in '94 from ski and college gigs in Vermont and New Hampshire to rockin' club dates in Boston, Philly, D.C. and elsewhere. On their home turf of New York City, the cousins have played to raving crowds at China Club, CBGCs, Wetlands, Village Gate, Lone Star, Bitter End, etc! Enjoy!             ",Bands

Having performed various types of Music, he then began to record solo acoustic guitar pieces which were compiled for his first release ""Storytale"" in 1988.   While searching for a new and unique medium, Jim began composing music for Doppelgitarre (a type of German harp guitar) in 1989. Having been introduced to engineer/producer Howard Toole in 1989, the two decided to co-produce an album. ""Music For Doppelgitarre"" was released in 1990. Jim performed in various places in Tennessee, then moved back to Charlotte in 1991. Since that time, Jim has been performing in various venues in the southeast, as well as composing instrumental music for the forthcoming release ""Pure White Monday"" and guitar/vocal music for his performances and future recordings.   ""Music for Doppelgitarre"" is a collection of ten solo doppelgitarre pieces. The music is very melodic in structure, and intended to convey a sense of serenity, color, and warmth. As stated in a review by Guitar Player magazine, ""perfect for a morning cup of Java or an evening of quiet solitude."" ""Pure White Monday"", however, is more diverse containing different musical styles including pieces for guitar, doppelgitarre, guitar synthesizer, and piano. Jim's vocal music is rather like ""introspective folk"", with lyrics to ""live by"" and both flowing and aggressive guitar phrases.   To order ""Music for Doppelgitarre"" send $14.00 for CD or $9.00 for cassette plus $1.50 shipping to CIR, P.O. Box 12505, Charlotte, NC 28220. ""Pure White Monday"" is not yet released as Jim is looking for a record company with interest in marketing it. For bookings or industry information, call 704/344-1819 or e-mail jandrews@cybernetics.net.      Songs included on IUMA    ""Momentum""  from ""Music for Doppelgitarre""    The mood for this piece is described by its title. It contains intricate phrases with harp string melodies mixed with quick guitar picking. The melody, as always, is evident as it strikes the contemplative side of the listener.    ""Serenity"" - a live guitar/vocal recording    The title is somewhat ironic, as this is one of the more aggressive pieces. It represents a good example of the diversity found in one of Jim's performances.   ""Doppelwerk""  from ""Pure White Monday""    This piece contains contrasting phrases from the doppelgitarre and piano. The movement continues a steady pace throughout the song, and the song was titled ""Doppelwerk"" as it sounds like a more melodic, acoustic version of a well known German techno band.

Most of the studio lives in a Macintosh IIvx computer with a 1.2 GB Hard Disk and Opcode's StudioVision sequencer/digital recorder. Pattrex used inexpensive and readily-available hardware and software for this effort. Mackie mixers were used, and Alesis effects devices. I recommend these brands pretty highly. Tannoy speakers (PBM 6.5s). Also, a basic Tascam 488 cassette 8 track was used to slave in some additional tracks. Pretty simple stuff, actually. The only semi-expensive element was an AKG C414 microphone I rented for a day for $10 from Private Studios in Champaign Illinois (thanks Jon! PS: call up and harass Jon at (217) 367-3530).

Coat pushes the limits of noise!  With their boy-girl-boy-girl line up, Coat can come off as gratifyingly raw or gleamingly pop. Yet this L.A. based quartet has a limitless capacity for drawing one in with achy guitar melodies.

""zoviet-amerikka"" closes the CD with a hip-hop and funk rampage that fades into a classical ode to the decay of the U.S.A.  ""nada is the product of years of frustrated attempts to create a distinctive band in the San Jose Area,"" said Robert M. Riddle IV. After playing with Autumn Cathedral , Riddle formed Swivelfaust and Slur before the decision to start nada as a solo project. Riddle enlisted the talents of other musicians, including Scott Martinez (Autumn Cathedral), Damien Gonzalez (Swivelfaust, Slur) and Mason Jones (Trance). The album was recorded at House of Faith in Palo Alto by Bart Thurber and produced by nada and Mason Jones. ""This is the most satisfying mix of electronic, experimental, psychedelic and rock music that I have been able to create so far.""  Nada uses influences as diverse as tribal drumming, techno sampling, hip-hop rhythms, wailing guitar and experimental noise to come up with a rich audio tapestry that is reminiscent of music by Coil , The Legendary Pink Dots and Savage Republic that should appeal most listening tastes.

35,"  Crosswind        Fairytales              (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 3:42 mins, 2.67M, 5.33M)     Rock                          After years of experience and dedication this swirling musical mass known as Crosswind now surges to gale force. Fed by an encouraging musical climate and drawing from potent wells of knowledge and ability, Crosswind has developed into a serious storm of sound and fury, ready to establish sovereignty. Quickly take this opportunity to examine the conditions and prevailing atmospheric circumstances that have merged and intersected to proudly produce Crosswind.  First there were simple honest goals which were almost always the truest direction to take. Often it takes a band or any collection of musicians a long time to arrive at that realization. Some never reach such a lofty level of understanding, but wallow hopelessly lost in bandwagon jumping, trend-observing confusion. Crosswind, however, is an example of a band whose members have come nearly full circle in development and found themselves staring squarely at the musical bottom line-- go with what you know!!  Diligently working thir way through ideas,expectations, views and objectives, often by way of countless ""hell gigs"" - the members of this bluesy guitar-driven rock ensemble: vocalist Dana Hall , guitarist Scottie Jordan , bass player Rich Barefoot and drummer Dan Ross ; have been savvy enough to grasp the concept that experience, a good work ethic and a straightforward stand is often the only way to rock and roll heaven. Sadly, today, the industry weather report frequently features bands that are here today, gone later today Not Crosswind!  The band has gathered strength around a brooding, talented and misleading calm eye - lead vocalist Dana Hall. She is the focal center of the Crosswind storm. She and her compatriots know that while success would be wonderful, being good, really good, offers the greater reward. Thus, the die was cast, their lot thrown together.  Crosswind was originally born out of the demise of several other Charlotte, N.C.-area bands. ""We were scared,"" Dana admits, ""we had to start over from scratch. Now, we've done a lot of road work, that has helped me to understand the idea of entertainment. Now it feels so good to be up there singing for other people, not for me -- but for everybody out there!""  With well over 300 gigs under their belt, Crosswind has established a solid live show and appeared alongside major regional and national acts (yes, some of these bands are still around!) such as: .38 Special, Mothers Finest, Kansas, Nightranger, The Outlaws, Steppenwolf, Copperhead, Molly Hatchet, Three Dog Night, The Georgia Satellites and Cry of Love.  Calling Crosswind a ""Southern-fried version of The Who"" Jordan believes that the availability of the bands music is a big part of the success equation. To fulfill that requirement, Crosswind recorded nine original songs on a cassette album entitled ""Can You Feel It?"" that they plan to distribute ""everywhere possible"". Recorded at White Room Studios in Charlotte, the new music on ""Can You Feel It?"" is a real representation of the soul of Crosswind.""Our sound is simple"", says Hall. ""We write what we feel, not what we think we're expected to write."" Calling the band's sound a mixture of Southern rock, anthem rock, the blues and hard rock, she adds ""This band has lots of energy. We pour it out onto the audiences in much the same fashion as a lot of 70's bands. We feed off the crowd and in return the crowd feeds off us.""  PRESS REVIEWS   Their better original stuff leans toward moody Led Zeppelin and raucous Aerosmith and steers clear of wimpy Journey-isms. Dana Hall has a strong rock n' roll voice, and they avoid the pretentious, ridiculous, stage-strutting monkeyshines of so many hard rockers.  - Charlotte Observer , September 25 1993  Crosswind delivers straight ahead rock n' roll as subtly as a slap in the face. A listen to the band's cassette ""Can You Feel It?"" proves us right. We felt it.  - Asheville Citizen-Times , January 13, 1995  This Charlotte outfit mixes some solid guitar crunch, an attitude that's aggressive without being threatening and the pipes of CL Best of Charlottes Best Female Vocalist winner Dana Hall.  - Creative Loafing February 1994    "" Can You Feel It?

Originating  from the Bay Area, which has provided a breeding ground for several top-notch Industrial groups that have become major forces in the international world of music, God Dog is one of the newer ""Tech Metal"" groups to burst upon the scene.  God Dog consists of the electronic and vocal talents of Steve Severino and guitarist/programmer, Mike Vaughn. The two have been working extensively since the fall of 1993 and have released a full-length independent CD, ""Of Love, Death and Blood"", as well as performing several live shows. The self professed goal of God Dog is to take the combination of metal and electronic technology to areas yet to be explored. Their sound takes this union and manipulates it in a way that is innovative and exciting yet not experimental in terms of song structure and melody. God Dog will appeal to people who like to hear Industrial music through a straight line rather than a jagged tunnel.

Emotionally charged and deep in meaning, Clan Diah produces sways from indie rock to heavier alternative. It's no wonder their appeal to the college scene keeps growing. Clan Diah is eclectic, yet ironically maintains a balanced, cohesive sound. They flow through a whole gamut of styles and sounds, but each song is uncontrived and honest. This sophisticated approach makes for timeless music. Clan Diah is song oriented with a communication of both mood and thought. This Cincinnati based quartet capitalizes on dynamics all through their debut CD "" The Train Journey North ."" If you haven't heard them have a taste and enjoy the Cincinnati style cookin'.    About the songs available on IUMA...   SKY SIGN : This tribute to the unseen fully explores the use of dynamics. It refers to the sense that we believe in many things not yet seen, or invisible. We can see the future by study of the past and we can see the invisible by the results it produces. This song has interesting changes in time signature and moods. It trips, it flies, it spirals out of control. What is communication but transfer of ideas and moods? Words too are invisible and yet still exist.  MIST COVERED MOUNTAINS : Simply Complicated and sadly beautiful. Christopher shows off some of his piping abilities on this piece. Originally composed by an unknown source in the early 1800's, this piece is sometimes rendered with Gaelic (trad. Scottish language) lyrics but more often the haunting melody is left alone to tell the tale of a traveler longing for the mist covered mountains of his home. This tune was a favorite of the late King George the VI and was played at his funeral. It was also played at the funeral of President John F. Kennedy. Highland bagpipes, acoustic guitar, and the distant harmonies of the whistles will leave an impression.  SYMBOL OF MY SHAME : Very Emotional! This song demonstrates the winding melodies and thick guitars. Listen hard and you'll hear Jay's marching band past. This song is rich in meaning. It refers to the moving irony of the feast of Christ's last meal. It was caused by man's failure, yet caused man's redemption. He said it symbolized His death and His blood. He then gave thanks to God for it and ate it.      These three songs are only a taste of Clan Diah's independently released CD ""The Train Journey North"" which is available by sending $11.00 plus $2.00 postage and handling to....  Clan Diah 265 Emming Street Apt. #3 Cincinnati, Ohio 45219     Some more stuff for those who care...  HISTORY OF CLAN DIAH  In Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1991 a few college friends started writing songs. Clan Diah, as a band started with the stereotypical ritual of arguing over what to name the band. They settled on ""Clan Diah"" which is an old Scottish phrase meaning ""the children of God."" This subtle reference to the divine nature of our humanity came from the Scottish influence of one of the members, Christopher McLennan, who is a nationally awarded bagpipe performer. After the name was chosen the band started playing out at local venues and coffee houses in the Cincinnati area.  Over the years the band did some quick recordings of songs for a demo tape. One song (""Matter of Time"") actually ended up on a nationally distributed compilation CD. With the confidence built by a very supportive local fan base, the success of the demo tape, and playing at a national music festival, the band embarked on its most ambitious endeavor yet...  In July of 1994, Clan Diah went into the studio to start recording its first full length compact disc. This self produced, independently released, and personally financed album is a statement of the band's abilities, commitment, and pro-active nature.  Clan Diah continues today to develop its loyal following. The band is presently shopping labels to give themselves the freedom to fully explore their potential. They wish you the best and hope you enjoy their work. See you on the ""Train Journey North.""    MEMBERS OF CLAN DIAH...   CHRISTOPHER MCLENNAN : Lead Guitar, Bagpipes, Penny whistles  Christopher is a 22 year old business major at the University of Cincinnati. From his young formative years he has played piano, violin, bagpipes, and the penny whistle. He was president of the Sycamore Orchestra and has won many national competitions on the bagpipes.

51,"  Markay, Barbara   Markay, Barbara         Change to Come              (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 3:48 mins, 2.73M, 5.46M)     Folk ,  Rock ,  Pop ,  World Beat                    In an age when popular musicians rely highly on sex, gimmickry and shameless hype to influence audiences and boost record sales, Barbara Markay is a standout talent with extraordinary musical abilities.  With roots grounded in a solid classical music background, Ms. Markay has worked with some of the top names in the industry, ranging trom Quincy Jones and Eric Clapton, to Carly Simon and George Duke. Her credits have also been splashed across Michael Jackson's ""BAD"" video, directed by Martin Scorsese, and on the Saturday Night Live band through Leon Pendarvis - the band's keyboard player with whom she worked.  Ms. Markay started out by winning a scholarship to New York's prestigious Juilliard School of Music where she studied composition with Roger Sessions and developed into an outstanding classical pianist. But despite her exceptional ability as a classical musician, she could not be confined to that genre. While still wearing pigtails and braces on her teeth, Ms. Markay was called on to showcase her prodigious talents to the European community as part of a popular college rock and roll tour sponsored by a couple of Britain's better known producers. She met the challenge  by performing to standing ovations on many European campuses. Upon arrival back to the United States, she was invited to perform in her own Miami Beach rock and roll review. She quickly followed that success with a dance music hit, ""It's Allrite,"" (released on WEA International in Holland). The tune wowed audiences in clubs all across the United States, and romped up the international music charts reaching an enviable No. 19 in Holland. That achievement was soon overshadowed by ""I Don't Wanna Be A Zombie,"" which zoomed to No. 2 on the French music charts, and demonstrated beyond a doubt that ""It's Allrite"" was no musical fluke.  In between these many successes Ms. Markay further demonstrated her multi-faceted musical talents with solid credits in live performances, record dates, voice-overs, background vocals, and jingles for which she was in great demand in New York City where she lived and worked until moving to the West Coast two years ago. Ms. Markay recently completed her latest album, ""Change To Come"" which she composed, arranged and produced, and on which she is also the lead vocalist and plays a number of musical instruments. The album features a dazzling array of background musicians, and has been getting rave reviews trom a number of well-respected music critics.

DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC :  ""Change To Come"" is an exciting, eclectic combination of songs which underscores the artist's spiritual and professional growth. The 11 tunes featured on this album shows a sensitivity for and understanding of the troubling issues which threaten to ravage our world--women's rights, the environment, the human condition, intolerance, and the overriding need for universal love. Markay has pulled this universality of themes together with an ingenious and exuberant intermingling of musical styles. The album is a triumph. Markay's fine-tuned musical acumen create an album that is professionally well-crafted, stylish and musically superior.

29,"  Challenge   Challenge         Soul Sirens              (Excerpt 120k, 180k / Full song 4.2 mins, 3.05M, 6.10M)     Rock                   With the release of their self-titled debut album, on Splash International Records, Challenge proves to be a natural to shape melodic rock of today. The CD is packed with emotion laden vocals, catchy guitars and most of all, memorable songs.  Challenge is Arno Verstappen on guitar and Allison Lindsay on vocals. With the help of fellow musicians and friends, who appear on this first offering, this duo is a force to be reckoned with.  Arno emphasizes that their goal is to make music which is less fad oriented. ""People have a hard time classifying our music because it's melodic, yet modern. Lately people seem to think that in order to be current, music has to be alternative or grunge. It's interesting, then, to note the current popularity of numerous melodic and classic rock bands. Since their songs have a timeless nature, they haven't had to jump on any trends to enjoy continued success. A position we want to be in.  While few female singers have had long lasting, enduring careers, Allison feels the tide is turning, ""Artists like Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Raitt are paving the way for women with strong melodies and honest emotional vocals. It's time for us to cut out the gimmicks and get back to strong vocal lines and great songs.""  The two first met in Hollywood in 1991, when Amo was auditioning to find the singer that could bring life to his music. Originally from Holland, Arno came to Los Angeles in 1989 to study at GIT (Guitar Institute of Technology). After graduation, he decided to stay in town to form a band. ""There are a lot more opportunities in Los Angeles. In Holland, the rock scene is very small,"" Arno clarifies. ""Few bands from there, with the notable exception of Golden Earring (who have been a great inspiration), are able to make a comfortable living out of playing music.""  Coming from opposite sides of the Atlantic exposed the two musicians to different styles of music. How does that influence the band? ""Arno grew up listening to the great European rock guitarists. Guys with lots of feel and personality,"" explains Allison. ""My influence has come from the dynamics of American singers. You could say we are now able to incorporate the best of both worlds into our own music.""  As for lyrical content, the band touches on matters of the heart as well as more serious topics. Allison elaborates, ""Everyone can find themselves in a love song but we also like to address other matters that inspire and concern us. Such as the ups and downs that present themselves in everyday life. ""  Next to being the voice for Challenge , Allison is gaining notoriety by teaching at Sabine Institute (for Vocal Strengthening and Development) in Los Angeles. Sabine Institute (established by renowned vocal coach Elizabeth Sabine) is famous for coaching many of rocks brightest stars including Axl Rose, Dave Mustaine, Brian Howe (Bad Co.). The Institute is currently branching out by bringing it's powerful technique to Japan, Australia and Italy.  The band has every reason to be confident about the road ahead. ""We know the time is right for us,"" stresses Amo. ""Alternative and grunge have clearly textured the 90's with their realistic depictions of the life styles of today's youth. However, history shows us that music trends tend to move in waves and Challenge will be on the crest of the rising tide of new melodic rock.""

As a white male, he watched his fellow Anglo-Americans create and perpetuate racist, prejudiced and sexist ideals. With his self-produced debut of ""Organic Hard-Core"" Rap he is out to unsettle the status quo and give them a dose, from one of ""their own"", of something that they have been deaf to for far too long... the TRUTH.               Adam Bomb's rhymes defend individual freedom, attack authority and define true liberty which, to him, is more than just privileges for the advantaged few. His music throbs and grooves with funky samples, rock and funk inspired guitar tracks, keyboards, and live horns.  ""Government, religion, and social standing are not excuses for racism, sexism, oppression and censorship by the powers that be,"" Adam Bomb says. ""The Constitution was a great document, in theory, but its ideals have not been afforded, to this day, to all men and womyn equally. It has never been anything more than a fairy tale to many of the people who in large part built this country, but have to ask permission to share the dream.""  His tracks confront everything from racist attitudes of the powers that be, to sexism and the failing two-party political system. ""Stand On Up"", inspired by a Malcolm X speech warn all races that things haven't changed enough to relax on any level, and that action like that of the 60's Civil Rights movement is still a must:   'Cause if you're sittin' then you're just a sittin' duck Lettin' those who choose, bombs instead of schools Still vote for the sucker, if ya vote at all fool  In ""Peacemaker, Soulshaker"", Adam Bomb serves up other ideologies he disdains -- misogyny, organized religion, bigotry and violence among all races of people who should be fighting the system rather than smoking dope, drinking ""40's"" and killing each other.  ""The System"" calls for an end to the two-party system which as Adam Bomb sees it is a farce. ""Although the two groups make a lot of noise espousing different points of view, they are essentially the same. They have their own best interests in mind and the true needs of the masses are not even an issue"".   My vision Destroy the institution With an urge ta purge suckers that are usin' up the masses Mutha fuckin' facists, I won't be passive Better believe I'm down for somethin' drastic... Enough of this evil Politicians gonna keep ya in submission till ya feeble  ""Everybody Get-A-Gun"" takes a sarcastic swipe at those in our society who are obsessed with firearms.   Mother don't cry, he only thought he was protecting you Not expecting to Take out his own son, with a cap from his own gun The same gatt we used ta shoot for fun... The Second Amendment Nothin' more than a remnant of our past The Second Amendment Propaganda from a Klansmen in my path  By attacking long since established views, values and philosophies, Adam Bomb is prepared for criticism from middle America. He is also prepared for the Hip-Hop and Rap communities to come at him as well by virtue of the fact that his skin is white. ""I've seen it happen, and quite frankly in many cases, people got what they deserved. I feel my music is different. My lyrics are relevant and I am not wasting people's time to fill my pockets. It's people's minds I hope to help set free"".  Realizing his passion for expressing himself through music at an early age, Adam Bomb formed a band with his brother when he was barely out of elementary school. He went from high school to study sound design at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. It was during his college years that Adam Bomb discovered a powerful from of expression that spoke to him and the ideals that he believed in vehemently. He walked in to a record store one day and knew that in Rap he had found his niche. ""I heard Public Enemy in a local store, and their message and delivery inspired me to change my outlook on music"", Adam Bomb recalls. ""Chuck D's lyrics were intelligent, deep and pertinent."" Chuck D, KRS-1 and Ice Cube became his strongest Rap influences.  Adam Bomb's first project was producing a young rapper named Stud B. As Adam Bomb learned about rap as an art form, he began producing tracks for both himself and Stud B, that were both political and original. Songs like ""Earth to the White Man"" and ""Proof is in the Pudding"", which was a reaction to the Rodney King beating, were results of the pairs collaboration.  Now a resident of Los Angeles, Adam Bomb continues to grow and evolve as an artist. He keeps his ears, heart and mind open for innovative sounds and ideas and persists at expressing the truth, which he hopes will force those ""in charge"" to finally own up to their wrongs and relinquish the power to those who should have had it all along.     Quotes and Other Stuff   Exploding across the Net, North America, and Europe! I got your tape in the post this morning. i listened to all of it before coming in to work. it really is great, 'organic hardcore' just about describes it for me. a couple of the tracks have got double vocals on them - are they both you? - one at a higher pitch than the other, this sounds a lot like early PE, I'm thinking of 'megablast' especially. I also picked up house of pain & ratm (your voice - in places) styles, yet not derivative, more expansive. I'll be playing your tape on my show tonight.

Mixed by Grammy award-winning songwriter and producer Randy Sharp, everyone who appears on this album is an accomplished artist in their own right. Vocal production is by Rosemary Butler (Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, etc. ) , who also lends her legendary talents as backup vocalist, along with Arnold McCuller (Phil Collins, James Taylor, K.T. Oslin, etc.) and Linda Tillery (Bobby McFerrin, Linda Ronstadt). Mike Finnigan is heard on organ (Rolling Stones, Crosby, Stills & Nash, etc.), Andrew Woolfolk on saxes (Earth, Wind and Fire, Phil Collins), and Debra Dobkin (Bonnie Raitt) on percussion. Don Kirkpatrick (Richard Marx, Amy Grant, etc.) blazes new flight paths with his amazing guitar work. All remaining keyboard work, as well as all of the basswork, is handled by Ms. Lindsay with her trademark grace and style ("" Best Bass Player "",  Reader's Choice Awards, Hot Wire magazine).

22-1642837685," Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death    Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death   Hello and Welcome!   This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for more improvements. My name is Alex Denner (denner@yale.edu) and I am doing research in the prediction of sudden cardiac death at Yale. Also, I would like to hear from anyone who is doing similar work or is interested in the field. (See below.)  I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death. This involves analyzing electrocardiograms to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Soon I will put more information about my work here.   An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle. The heart is comprised of four chambers. Blood enters the heart into the two atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and right). The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short delay, the ventricular muscles contract. On the electrocardiogram ""waves"" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the ventricular repolarization can be seen. Currently, my work is concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most serious, ventricular fibrillation. Fibrillation is a state of the heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously. During fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart.    This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor (It is a postscript file.)   I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular fibrillation sometime in the future. One of my favored techniques is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to be distinguished spatially.     To Those Interested in Cardiology/Sudden Cardiac Death/VF:  I would like to get together a mailing list or group of people who are interested in issues related to ventricular arrhythmias and/or ECG signal analysis.

165-1851737163,"     Research Triangle Pharmaceuticals - RTP    RTP Research Triangle Pharmaceuticals  4364 S. Alston Ave. Durham NC 27713 tel: (919) 361-2277 fax: (919) 361-2290  Table of Contents   Company Profile   People at RTP   MicroCrystal   Technology Profile   Advantages of MicroCrystals Technology   MicroCrystal Technology vs. Liposomes   Oral Availability   Payload Capacity   Sustained Release   Immediate Release   Toxicity   Marketing Exclusivity   Conclusion     Company Profile  RTP is a technology development company. The primary business focus of RTP is to acquire, develop, and out-license novel pharmaceutical products and technologies that offer significant medical and health care benefits. Among other innovations, the MicroCrystal(TM) drug delivery system for water-insoluble drugs is RTP's flagship technology.  ToC   MicroCrystal   Technology Profile  MicroCrystal(TM) technology consists of encapsulation of a water-insoluble pharmaceutical agent in natural or semi-synthetic phospholipids. The final product is a very fine aqueous suspension of submicron-sized (0.3 to 1.0 micron) phospholipid-coated drug -- MicroCrystals. The components used in MicroCrystal technology are biocompatible and are classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized As Safe. Both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms are available.  The concept of using phospholipids for drug delivery has intrigued scientists for decades. After years of research, RTP has successfully devised a lipid-based drug delivery system for oral, parenteral, or topical administration of hydrophobic compounds.   ToC  Advantages of MicroCrystal Technology  The MicroCrystal drug delivery system offer many advantages over other drug drug delivery systems. These advantages ranges from payload capacity to marketing exclusivity. RTP is committed to the MicroCrystal drug delivery system.  ToC  MicroCrystal Technology vs. Liposomes  Unlike liposomes, which are primarily meant to entrap water-soluble agents, MicroCrystal formulations are ideal for water-insoluble drugs.   MicroCrystal(TM)   Inner core is hydrophobic  Lipid chains point inward  High payload  Extended shelf life  Less expensive to manufacture  Not retained by the RES   Liposomes   Inner core is hydrophilic  Phosphate groups point inward  Relatively low payload capacity  Limited shelf life  Relatively expensive to manufacture  Retained by RES   The goal of a drug delivery system is to provide a patient-friendly formulation that is capable of delivering medically relevant amounts of drug. The versatility and reliability of the MicroCrystal technology provide many advantages over formulations that employ organic solvents and detergents to achieve adequate drug payloads.  ToC  Oral Availability  Improvement if oral availability using MicroCrystal technology has been demonstrated in dog and rat models with various drugs that are known to have poor oral availability. For example, MicroCrystal-formulated acyclovir in a cross-over study with sonicated bulk suspensions. In animal models, the bioavailability of acyclovir increased by 76%, and the bioavailablity of cefuroxime increased by 385%.  ToC  Payload Capacity  MicroCrystal technology produces high concentrations (up to 200 mg/mL) of physiologically compatible oral and parenteral formulations. MicroCrystal formulations may be lyophilized for subsequent reconstitution, pressed into tablets, or filled into capsules.  ToC  Sustained Release  Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of MicroCrystal formulations provide a tissue-compatible, sustained release lasting 12 to 96 hours. The slow release pattern results from encapsulation of the raw drug with phospholipids. Additional advantages of MicrCrystal sustained release include consistent blood levels of drug and high tissue compatibility.  ToC  Immediate Release  MicroCrystal technology delivers immediate release of drug through intravenous dosing. The rapid dilution of MicroCrystals improves the binding process of drug to plasma proteins.   ToC  Toxicity  Pilot intravenous toxicity sudies in rats show that the dose-dependent toxicity profiles of MicroCrystal formulations are identical to those seen with drugs that are not formulated using MicroCrystal technology. Additionally, in an acute toxicity study in rabbits (Draize Test), MicroCrystal-formulated drugs failed to produce significant irritation. These results indicate that no additional toxic effects are produced by the components of the MicroCrystal formulations.  ToC  Marketing Exclusivity  Through extensive U.S. and internationally issued and pending patents, MicroCrystal techology offers a patentable drug delivery system. For drugs approaching off-patent status, MicroCrystal technology offers a potential patent-extension strategy. MicroCrystal formulations can be commercially manufactured using currently available equipment and excipients.  ToC  Conclusion  Versatility and reliability are essential elements of successful drug delivery systems. The MicroCrystal drug delivery system offers the following advantages:  applicable to all dosing routes  reduces toxicity of parenteral formulations by eliminating the need for organic solvents or extreme pH  improved oral bioavailability offers the opportunity to convert parenteral-only formulations to oral formulations  may lower the required oral dose for drugs that are poorly absorbed  enables the commercialization of otherwise therapeutically effective drugs whose development has been halted due to difficulties in formulation or lack of appropriate bioavailability  the manufacturing process is relatively simple and is readily amenable to commercial scale production  extensive patent protection offers a unique product-line extension strategy  Call Research Triangle Pharmaceuticals to learn if the MicroCrystal drug delivery system is the solution to your formulation challenge.

4," Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death    Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death   Hello and Welcome!   This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for more improvements. My name is Alex Denner (denner@yale.edu) and I am doing research in the prediction of sudden cardiac death at Yale. Also, I would like to hear from anyone who is doing similar work or is interested in the field. (See below.)  I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death. This involves analyzing electrocardiograms to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Soon I will put more information about my work here.   An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle. The heart is comprised of four chambers. Blood enters the heart into the two atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and right). The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short delay, the ventricular muscles contract. On the electrocardiogram ""waves"" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the ventricular repolarization can be seen. Currently, my work is concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most serious, ventricular fibrillation. Fibrillation is a state of the heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously. During fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart.    This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor (It is a postscript file.)   I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular fibrillation sometime in the future. One of my favored techniques is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to be distinguished spatially.     To Those Interested in Cardiology/Sudden Cardiac Death/VF:  I would like to get together a mailing list or group of people who are interested in issues related to ventricular arrhythmias and/or ECG signal analysis. Email me at denner@yale.edu or use my email reply form . Also, if you are just browsing this page or my other WWW pages, let me know what you think!

26-907175364,"   NORD 1    National Organization for Rare Disorders    Not so rare   ""Our son was misdiagnosed for more than two years. You cannot imagine the nightmare we lived through. The professionals we saw could not identify his illness. We spent huge sums of money searching for an answer. When his disorder was finally diagnosed, we learned that it was so rare, physicians knew little about it. There seems to be no treatment, and very little research giving us hope for his future."" Although this parent thought her story was unique, millions of Americans with rare disorders have suffered similar agonies. Names of their illnesses may be different, but most have experienced the indignity of searching for help in vain. Rare disorders are ""back of the textbook"" illnesses, unfamiliar to the general public and professionals alike. They can strike people of all ages, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds.

104-433832350," HospitalWeb       Welcome to HospitalWeb , a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.  This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing potential of the World Wide Web. Providing a simple and globally accessible way for patients , medical researchers , and physicians to get information on any hospital in the world is the goal.   This list is of ""main"" webservers (only webservers at hospitals will be listed). Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online (due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without ""top-level"" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete. If you run or know of a hospital webserver, please send me mail and I will add it immediately!  This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital that doesn't have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).  Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List! I've just set up a listserv for HospitalWeb. Topics will be anything to do with hospitals on the Internet and the WWW, and I hope it will grow into a discussion forum where everyone can voice their opinions/questions about the future of hospitals and the Internet. If you want to join in this forum, please send email to hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu with the subject "" help "" for info on how to subscribe.

21-59253759," Malaria Database  MALARIA DATABASE     Funded by: UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases  Maintained at: The Department of Microbiology, Monash University and The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research     Anonymous FTP site  This site contains a number of text files of nucleotide and protein sequence data. In one directory directory I list files that were included in the last mailout. In another directory are files added since then. If you use the links below to grab any file, be aware that you will be getting the version sent in the last mailout, so you just may want to check the new directory to see if there is anything later. The files exist in several different formats:    Annotated Nucleotide sequences in EMBL format. Beware that this is a very large file occupying about 4 Mb at last count.  Annotated Nucleotide sequences in GCG format. Note: this directory contains thousands of files and takes a while to list in your web browser.  Unannotated nucleotide sequences suitable for importation into PC programs  Annotated Protein Sequences in EMBL format  Unannotated protein sequences suitable for importation into PC programs  List of expressed sequence tags of Plasmodial genes These are included in annotnuc.dat but are separately listed here with BLAST search results for each EST.    Malaria Genome Information This list tells you about known chromosome markers for the 14 chromosomes of P. falciparum. The list is cross-referenced to the database and the probe list so that you can identify a researcher who can supply you with an appropriate probe   Malaria strain information The WHO funds a malaria strain bank that is maintained at the Institute Of Cell And Animal Biology, University Of Edinburgh by  Dr. David Walliker.  Listed here are the various isolates and cloned lines of malaria that are available by contacting David.    P. falciparum isolates  P.falciparum cloned lines  Mouse malaria strains   Availability of Clones and probes This list gives you the name and addresses of researchers who can supply you with nucleic acid probes or cloned sequences.   Bibliography of references about malaria antigens Here you will find listings of references about several malaria antigens. I try and keep this current but anyone who wishes to adopt an antigen, please do so.   Alignment of malaria antigen sequences Some malaria antigens exist in multiple allelic forms. Here you will find alignments for MSP-1 , MSP-2 , AMA-1 ,  Duffy binding proteins and the family of erythrocyte binding antigens.

18-1884751139,"   Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford      Center Description  The Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford was established in 1990 to create links between academic, research, and administrative computing activities in the Stanford University School of Medicine , and to serve as a source of advice to the Deans office on informatics issues. The Center was then funded in 1992 by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to create a shared computing resource to support research activities in biomedical informatics. This resource is also named CAMIS and supports an active core research program, the computing infrastructure and day-to-day computing needs of a large number of researchers, each of whom has external support from NIH (the National Institutes of Health) or other agencies through grants or contracts. Though the CAMIS resource is Stanford -based, its mission has a national character, which includes support of national electronic mail distribution lists, extensive on-line information resources, an annual CAMIS symposium, three academic training programs, a visiting scholar program and a national advisory council. The nominal location of CAMIS is in the Medical School Office Building (MSOB) on the Stanford University campus .    General Information   Includes answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Please read this before sending email to the maintainers of this web.  Academic Programs   Descriptions of the degree programs in medical informatics and related disciplines at Stanford University. Also includes information about the Informatics Short Course as well as other medical informatics training environments in the United States.  Research Groups   Information about past and present research groups.  Publications   Technical report abstracts and PostScript where available.  Calendar of Events   Announcements of interest to the local CAMIS community including colloquia, symposia, journal club and other meetings.  People   Profiles of members of the CAMIS community.

1," HospitalWeb       Welcome to HospitalWeb , a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.  This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing potential of the World Wide Web. Providing a simple and globally accessible way for patients , medical researchers , and physicians to get information on any hospital in the world is the goal.   This list is of ""main"" webservers (only webservers at hospitals will be listed). Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online (due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without ""top-level"" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete. If you run or know of a hospital webserver, please send me mail and I will add it immediately!  This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital that doesn't have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).  Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List! I've just set up a listserv for HospitalWeb. Topics will be anything to do with hospitals on the Internet and the WWW, and I hope it will grow into a discussion forum where everyone can voice their opinions/questions about the future of hospitals and the Internet. If you want to join in this forum, please send email to hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu with the subject "" help "" for info on how to subscribe.

Although I've seen many medical resources on the Web, I've never seen a simple and complete list of hospitals on the web. This has probably confused patients and physicians simply looking for specific hospital information ( lists of specialists, email addresses for physicians, specific departmental information, admitting information, clinical trials, maps, etc...? ) Hence, I've started this list on my own, and hope that people will use it as a reference point. Please email me if you have a hospital to include!

137-1583583926,"   Kuntz group welcome page     WELCOME TO THE KUNTZ GROUP!    The Kuntz lab consists of two groups: a ""dockers"" group, which is working on issues in structure-based drug design, and an NMR group. The main focus of the dockers group is the development of tools for the discovery of lead compounds once the 3D structure of a target receptor is known. Our best known tool is the program DOCK , which searches databases of chemical structures for potential lead compounds for a particular receptor. We've also been developing BUILDER, for design of novel compounds to interact with particular receptor, and are experimenting with QSAR applications of DOCK.   DOCK 3.5 is now available!   More information about us     The DOCK page    New Features in DOCK 3.5   BUILDER page   List of current references from dockers group   Who's in the Kuntz Group?

HealthNet Projects    HealthNet to GO!  HealthNet to GO! is an exercise to optimize currently available Internet tools for the health community. It consists of a number of different packages which can be easily installed and allow the health Internet user to easily access a number of different health related sites.  Important !!! Disclaimer : HealthNet to GO! is NOT a commercial product, is NOT for resale purposes, is NOT supported and we take NO responsiblity for any problems it may cause. It is a reconfiguration of different currently available Internet software to ""point"" to health related content around the Internet. HealthNet to GO! and the related projects with the goal of enabling users to make better use of the content that is currently available to them.  It is currently available for Windows 3.1x formats and assumes that the user either has access to SLIP (or SLIP like access - through something like TIA ), or a direct connection via a LAN and is thus capable of using Windows 3.1x interfaces to access the Internet.   It is hoped that by providing easier installation and preconfigured pointers that new health users on the Internet will be able to start using Internet to be able to assist them in their work.   HealthNet to GO is available in a number of formats   a) FORMAT1: The full ""plug and play format""  HealthNet to Go! has an easy plug and play install package and should be installed from three 1.44M, 3.5"" Diskettes.

Once subscribed, members are automatically sent E-mail copies of all communications sent to those lists. Generally, one subscribes by sending an E-mail message to the List Server containing the following information in the message area:    subscribe LISTNAME your_first_name your_last_name    You then will get further instructions that tell you how to post messages to the List Address , unsubscribe, find out who is on the list, and other capabilities.  Some of the lists archive their discussions and place them in public directories. If this is done (and we know about it), the message archives can be examined without necessarily signing up as a member. This provides a means to look at the list's content and determine whether you are interested or not in becoming a member. If the list contents are archived the YES entry in the Archived? column will be highlighted below and you can click on it to see the archive.  The table below summarizes the key information you need to contact each of these lists. Clicking on the List Name jumps to a description of that particular list. To subscribe you must send an E mail message to the List Server , as explained above. If your WEB browser supports ""mail"" and you have your E-mail address handy, you can sign up for any of these lists right now by clicking on its respective List Server in the table below.

The INTVIO-L list serves as a networking system devoted to all aspects of family violence. While various other lists may explore the topics of child abuse or violence within the family, the intimate violence list is unique in that it serves a wide range of areas that constitute the definition of intimate violence. This list is designed to encompass all areas of interest regarding family violence rather than limiting discussion to one interest.     EJINTVIO , the Electronic Journal of Intimate Violence, is published as a list. Topics include physical child abuse, sexual child abuse, child neglect, physical spouse abuse, sexual spouse abuse, psychological abuse, elder abuse, and dating violence, as well as other related topics subscribers may wish to explore.

If a newsgroup is established you generally have to look at the postings, but you don't have to sign up to view the messages. However, you may need newsreader software to take full advantage of newsgroups and you must have access to a Usenet (NNTP) server. Some WWW browsers like NETSCAPE have newsreaders built in but you still need access to a Usenet server. There are thousands of newsgroups. To automatically be sent copies of newsgroup messages related to a particular topic, explore the powerful capabilities of Stanford's Netnews Information Filtering Tool (SIFT). SIFT enables users without access to a Usenet server to get filtered newsnet postings.

We invite other sites to submit URL's on related information for incorporation into our subnet, and we also invite the submission of materials to include.  The mission of this site is to provide a reference point for information regarding Dataspace related items, where Dataspace is a dynamic, distributed voxel database. This would include works dealing with the rendering of voxel data, manipulation and simulation of voxel models, and distributed computing algorithms.  After you have finished exploring our site, feel free to submit comments using our  Comments Form   Please use the text-based or image-based navigation scripts at the top of each page to explore our extensive World Wide Web offerings.  Update:   Vox-L Inc. was one of the first companies to license Lateiner Dataspace's volume rendering technologies (the MRI images in the greeting banner were generated using these algorithms). Vox-L's Visualizer software has incorporated Lateiner Dataspace technology since 1992. In 1994, Vox-L licensed additional technology, including an embedded version of Dataspace TM (our high-speed volumetric object database) for use in the Vox-L Visualizer (incorporating the database to power Vox-L's segmentation and classification tools). In addition, Vox-L recently licensed the Dataspace Object Manager to power the communication between the Vox-L Visualizer and Vox-L Extension processes built using the Vox-L API (see for more information ).  Vox-L Inc. has stated that their next goal is to license Dataspace simulation technology for incorporation into the Vox-L Visualizer to enable enhanced Virtual Surgery applications.

Virtual Library      The PCR In Situ   While the polymerase chain reaction provides an extremely powerful tool for the analysis of populations of cells, the PCR In Situ extends this technology to the single cell level.

The Hidden Layers: A Fluid Molecular Biology Didactic Platform  Teaching a course on state of the art molecular biology is challenging as the underlying technologies advance faster than print support media can accomodate. In addition, the essential computational tools are generally ignored as the difficulty of supporting multiple platforms and capacities are virtually insurmountable.

ESSAY: IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON.   I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.  I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.  Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documantaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.  I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.  I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradice Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for CIA. I sleep only once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I succesfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me. ",Goats

The goats sense her, too. They're watching me nervously, walking around in small circles, never straying too far out of my sight. My slightest movement sends them into a panic. Even my songs barely calm them.   My keepers are planning something special, they tell me cryptically. Although they have lied to me in the past, I know this time they're for real. The goats know. The moon knows.   I raise the pipes to my lips, and practice the song I've written for her, the song I've been waiting to play for centuries.   Clouds pass in front of the moon.

44,"   Cygnus People       Cygnus Support Animal Preserve     Welcome to the Cygnus Animal Preserve! Cygnus animals, past, present, and future are electronically represented here.   Cats  Pati and her husband Pete have two cats, Bogart  and Frodo . Bogart is the troublemaker of the two.   Stan and Natalie have two cats, Mackey and Velcro . Mackey's name derives from the Mac the Knife (he was named by Natalie's daughter when she was young), while Velcro is notable for his clinginess. Eventually we'll add an illustration of this... At 14 and 18 pounds, Mackey and Velcro are both lapfuls!   Dawn has 3 happy fur balls named Tiger, Slinky and Zipidie. Tigers are wonderful things, Slinky thinks she's a spring, and Zipidie isn't so zippy now that he's a whopping 18 pounds. .  Dogs  Gordon's roommate's dog, Roque , is in charge of system security at base.com .  Juno , the world's most spastic canine, can leap tall fences in a single bound, chase cars with the grace of a penguin, shatter glass with a single bark, and coat an entire arm with slobber in a single lick. If anyone dared enter his  master 's territory, they'd be loved to death in seconds.   Goats  Ian 's parents run a cashmere goat farm. Here is a picture of  Lady , a doe imported from Australia, and two of her kids. There are more goat pictures at the Black Locust Farm home page.  Pigs  Piggio is a very happy pink pot pellied pig. After a not terribly successful career as company mascot at 3DO, he hopes to change his name to Pignus and become Cygnus' new garbage disposal, in spite of the more popular notion that the job might be better served by a goat. He's had some very interesting adventures and has his very own  web page to tell you all about it.  Birds  Cygnus' animal preserve wouldn't be complete without a bird sanctuary, and in fact, you'll find one in Dawn 's house.  At last count, there were 7 feathered squawkers and 10 more cooking in the nest. And well, you know what they say about big birds, ""they make big poos"". Here are some of their pictures if you'd like to meet some of them:  Cookie , the scary cookatoo, Happy , the lonely cockatiel, Cirrus and Tinsel , are two parakeets with half a brain each, Yin , the lovebird who hates everyone, Casper and Snowwhite , the albino cockatiels whose eggs won't hatch, and Phoenix , the jeolous conure.  Fish  Stan and Natalie also have a number of koi and goldfish in their outdoor pond. In the summer, they like to come up to the surface and suck on your fingers. Perhaps someday we'll get a picture of the heron that has eaten several of our fish. We usually keep a net over the pond to prevent any more such tragic events.  Everything Else  Herman lives in a shell. He's very quiet, doesn't eat much, and doesn't get around too much. We often wonder if he's still alive.

It is characterized by physical, chemical, and usually bacteriological changes in the milk and by pathological changes in the udder. Early recognition and prompt treatment are important for limiting tissue damage and production losses. However, since treatment is often unrewarding, emphasis should be on mastitis control and prevention.

As such, you are certainly aware of the coffee discovery legend. To review: A few hundred years ago some African goatherders saw their goats cavorting with unusual great enthusiasm. Investigating, the goatherders traced the behavior to the coffee cherries the goats were eating. From this they learned to make a new beverage called kaffe.  This is a lame story. Africa has been inhabited for thousands of centuries and just twenty generations ago people discovered coffee? Because for the first time goats decided to eat coffee beans? It's hincky! There is strong evidence to suggest that coffee is a new arrival on planet earth. It was brought here to wake people up.

2,"  The Goat Shrine    The Goat Shrine  This page is fondly dedicated to Heidi Geshel, who knows the joys of living in a goat-infested room and who also gave me the wit and inspiration to do this page!      GOATS! GOATS! GOATS! GOATS! GOATS!  GOATS! GOATS!   Why are Goats so Cool? Oh, c'mon, just look at them. They're amazing. Not only are they cute, but what other animal are you going to find that both eats your garbage  and can make its own milk? Exactly. Besides, goats are just cool by nature. They make great sources of consolation in times of grief, plus there are many unconfirmed rumors that they also make good sex counselors too.   The Beard: An Evolutionary Link Truly, Darwin was on to something. Think about it. Goats have beards.  People have beards. Hmm...could it be we that we and goats have a closer family bond than we'd previously believed? And if so, why, goats may be on par with monkeys, dolphins, and white mice in intelligence. Why, this practically makes goats family to us!   Fear from the Masses Yes, that's right, most people just can't handle the power that goats represent. That's why our society is trying to put them down and repress the danger that goats hold for the weak-willed's stagnant and close-minded ways of life. Goats offer us freedom--a new and enlightened way of life that will help us transcend the mundaneness of the everyday world and take us to the ultimate level of perfection that we possess within ourselves. So don't be decieved by claims that goats are only good for milk and cheese or angora and cashmere. Realize that those beliefs are only the last-chance efforts of a desperate group of people trying to pose as a stumbling block to the new order.  Only by knowing the truth can you become free.    How Did I Become Hooked? Well, I really don't know. This hobby/interest/obssesion of mine has been going on for a few number of years now, but I can't quite pinpoint how it started. Mostly I think I saw some goats at a fair and was struck by how cute they can be. Plus, liking goats isn't quite the same as liking dolphins or puppies, so the attention/amusement factor I get from this is worth it. Besides, the quest for finding goat &quotthings&quot isn't easy, so it makes for a fun time. However, the love of goats is a  double-edged sword which isn't always easy to wield. One example was when I took my niece (who was 3 years old back then) to a petting zoo which had goats who were intent on mobbing her and eating her clothing. I &quotrescued&quot her, and she's recovered quite nicely since then (thanks to many readings of &quotThe Three Billy Goats Gruff,&quot) but the whole incidence just shows that goats have a dark side  that can be unleashed if their power isn't properly reckoned with.    My Goats For those of you that care (and heck, I'm impressed if anyone's actually read this far!), I have my own collection of goats. Ok, they're not real live goats, but I think terming them as merely inanimate is harsh, as these goats definitely have a personality and prescence all their own.  Here they are, in the order I obtained them...   Inspector Gadget's Goat : Yeah, I realize it's a pathetic name, but it's the closest he's got. He's just a small, brown plastic goat and he has an equally small plastic Inspector Gadget figurine riding him, hence the name.  The Straw Goat : Another lack-luster name, but again, very descriptive. The Straw Goat is a self-standing goat made out of straw who is no more than a foot high. He was given to me by my friend Anjanette, who obtained him from a store in Florida that bears his name.  Kimball : Kimball is the &quotflag-goat&quot of my collection. He's a small stuffed white goat (whose picture can be seen in various parts of my home page) who was given to me by my friend Stacy. Kimball's been a constant companion and has even survived a trip to Hell (Michigan) and back.  Kelsey : Kelsey is a small porcelin ornament of a brown goat with a carrot in his mouth. I got Kelsey for Christmas from John Wallace, who was my Secret-Santa at the time. Right now, Kelsey is perched on my desk guarding my book collection.  Kalliope : Ok, there's some discrepency that Kalliope might actually be a llama, but we're not really sure. She's a small (tiny, even) stuffed red goat with neat designs on her. David got her for me in the Carribbean, which by the way, is a virtual haven for free-running goats.  Kassidy : Kassidy is practically Kimball's twin. The only difference between them is the color of ribbon they wear around their necks and the shade of brown that their horns are. Kassidy was a gift from John and Heidi, and she has seen me through many troubled times.  Gadriel : Gadriel is the newest addition. He's a very  big goat with gray fur and vivid blue eyes. He was purchased at the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair for me by David, and due to Gadriel's size, hugging him is almost like hugging a real goat. Of course, I've never actually hugged a real goat, and I'm guessing that hugging Gadriel is probably a more enjoyable experience.     More Goat Sources...  Yes, they do actually exist, and here are the ones that I recommend:  The Irvine Mesa Charros 4-H Club's Goat Page --This is a great source for real goat info and facts, complete with tons of pictures, sounds, and diagrams.

20,"     Bibliography Feral Goats       FERAL GOATS IN AUSTRALIA: AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY  PREPARED BY JUDITH NEWLAND B.V.Sc., Grad. Dip. LIM  1994  Contact: c/- ANCA Library, ph (06) 250 0205  INTRODUCTION  PREFACE  The earliest recorded arrival of goats in Australia was with the First Fleet in 1788. Goats are exceptionally hardy animals able to survive and reproduce on poor quality feed and limited water. These very traits that made goats indispensable to the early settlers are the qualities that now make the feral goat an environmental menace.  The versatile, easily handled, domesticated goat accompanied the pioneers, the miners and the railway gangs to wide areas of Australia. The goat was a ready source of milk and meat and in some places goats were used for light haulage and racing. An early mohair industry added to introductions in Victoria and Western Australia. As the country developed the settlers turned to cows for milk, and sheep and cattle for meat. The wool industry rapidly supplanted the early mohair industry. Unwanted goats were often set free or escaped to form the basis of today's feral herds.  This bibliography covers the broad subject of feral goats in Australia. Material listed is from a variety of sources: monographs, journals, conference proceedings, working papers, newspaper reports. It includes history, distribution, control methods, diseases, exploitation for meat, fibre and hides and the environmental impact of feral goats. Research programs on biological behaviour and production potential are included. Newspaper articles report on the emotional response of the general public to feral goats and on the efforts of agricultural extension workers.  Through the bibliography the changing attitudes towards feral goats and care for the environment can be traced. During the 1960s the approach to goat control in some areas was by poisoning watering holes with arsenic, whereas the 1990s approach is towards the development of an effective strategic management plan integrated with ecologically sustainable land management. The different attitudes of pastoralists and conservationists are highlighted. The pastoralists despise the goat because it competes for grazing with domestic sheep and cattle while acknowledging that in times of drought they make more money from killing feral goats for the meat trade than from sheep or cattle. The conservationists are concerned with the goat's role in destruction of native flora, competition with native fauna and erosion of the land.  In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in feral goats as a source of cashmere, as the base stock for upgrading Angora flocks, and as a source of meat for the export trade. These developments are all reflected by the material listed in this bibliography.  LEVEL  This bibliography aims to provide information of use to a variety of groups with varying levels of interest in feral goat control and/or exploitation. It provides references for professional officers working with feral animal control programs, biological behaviour and disease control programs. Material is listed of importance to the pastoral community interested in exploiting feral goats for meat, fibre and weed control. Conservationists are provided with references on environmental impact.  LIMITATIONS  The bibliography was limited to material published in English about feral goats in Australia. There was no set chronological period covered. Miscellaneous fact sheets published by State Departments of Agriculture, and some Western Australia and South Australian minor magazines containing references to feral goats were not readily available in Canberra and are not included in the bibliography.  ARRANGEMENT  Arrangement of the bibliography is under broad subject headings to make it relatively easy to find an area of interest. Secondary arrangement is chronological by date of publication. Ascending order of publication emphasises the historical attitudinal changes to feral goats and environmental management. Newspaper and hobby-farmer magazine articles are listed under the one heading. Items giving a general overview on many different aspects of feral goats are listed together.

CAB ABSTRACTS   &quot;Diet of feral goats was recorded by direct observation in a shrub-dominated Eucalyptus populnea woodland in New South Wales on 7 sampling occasions during 2 years. Different nutritional opportunities were provided by the effects of rainfall on 4 contrasting grazing treatments. The goats foraged evenly over the paddocks and encountered most foods with the same frequency as they occurred. With unlimited quantities of forage available the goats spent 63% of their time grazing and only 28% browsing. Most browsing took place in dry conditions when pasture quality was low. When forage was in short supply the goats accepted some shrubs not normally eaten, and these plants died; other woody plants were eaten erratically or not at all. Acacia aneura was the only woody plant which was palatable and resilient to goat browsing. Goats mostly ate the same plant species as sheep and with the same preference, but tended to eat more browse than sheep in dry times. The browse consumed was principally the same as that consumed by sheep, demonstrating sequential competition for dry-season fodder. Goats demonstrated a potential for overgrazing in dry times, indicating that stocking rates must be adjusted at such times to avoid pastures becoming extinct.&quot;  27. O'Brien, P. H.

Author's abstract:   &quot;Measurements indexing the mating system, home range, peri-parturient behaviour, and group size and composition of feral goats were used to compare studied populations. Geographically diverse populations were similar in most behavioural characteristics and their social systems had similar structures. However, post-partum behaviour and mating systems showed both quantitative and qualitative differences between populations. These similarities and differences are discussed in relation to the diverse selection history of feral goats. It is postulated that selective changes occurring during domestication may contribute to the variability observed in post-partum behaviour and mating systems.&quot;  Includes tabled results and bibliography.  28.

Home ranges of males were larger (ranging from 139.2 to 587.7 sqkm) than those of females, which ranged from 15.0 to 190.2sqkm. Excursions outside the normal (90 percentile) home ranges were common. The home ranges of females were smaller during summer than winter. Male home ranges were of similar size in both seasons. Group structure and composition was highly variable. Implications of goat movements on management and control programmes are discussed.&quot;  Includes tables, figures and bibliography.  DISEASE IN FERAL GOATS  29. McKenzie, R. A., Green, P.

(1985) &quot;An abattoir survey of the prevalence of caseous lymphadenitis in feral goats in Western Australia&quot;. Australian veterinary journal, 62 (11) 1985, pp. 385-386.  Presents results of a survey of 900 feral goats processed through an export abattoir in Western Australia demonstrating 3.1% of goats had caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) lesions in lymph nodes or organs while 13.7% had positive antibody titres. Survey was conducted to correlate prevalence of CLA in W. A. feral goats with that encountered in surveys in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. Discusses lesions, sites of lesions, bacteria involved, reasons for discrepancy between presence of lesions and positive antibody titres. Notes post mortem inspection did not include head and neck. Refers to reports of high incidence of head and neck lesions in domestic goats. Concludes true prevalence of CLA in feral goats in all states is likely to be higher than reported as routine post mortem inspections have not included lymph nodes of head and neck. Suggests future surveys include examination of entire carcase.  31. Batey, R. G., Speed, C. M., Kobes, C. J. (1986) &quot;Prevalence and distribution of caseous lymphadenitis in feral goats&quot;.

With prices for feral goats exceeding prices for sheep; goats are no longer seen as vermin but as an important alternative income source for pastoralists in semi-arid and arid areas of Western Australia. This study examines the distribution and prevalence of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and considers the significance of feral goats as a potential source of infection for sheep or goats. Results showed that of 2920 feral goats slaughtered at a Perth abattoir in 1984, 7.8% had lesions of CLA. Of the affected goats, 49.3% had head, 46.7% body and 12.3% visceral lesions. Results were compared with previously reported data from sheep and significant differences are discussed. Head lesions were common in goats but absent in sheep; lung lesions were less common in goats than sheep; carcase lesions was similar in both species while multiple lesions were less common in goats than in sheep.  32.

Author's summary:   &quot;Caseous lymphadenitis was the most frequently encountered pathological condition in 3,720 feral goats examined during routine meat inspection procedures. Among nine separate consignments of animals the prevalence of infection averaged 7.4% (range 0.3%-18.8%). The majority of lesions were seen in lymph modes draining superficial body areas although many also occurred in internal modes and organs. Corynebacterium ovis was isolated from 25 of 32 lesions submitted for bacteriological examination. Other conditions regularly encountered included pneumonia, cysticercosis, sarcosporidiosis and lice infestation, while myonecrosis, pleurisy, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, cirrhosis and mite infestation were only occasionally found. A total of 171 serum samples were collected and tested against 17 antigens. Samples from 57.9% and 51.5% showed positive serological reactions to the antigens for sarcosporidiosis and Q fever respectively.&quot;  Includes tabled results, references.  34. Williams, M. L.

CAB ABSTRACTS:   &quot;A scheme developed to encourage landowners to develop goat enterprises has been successful in demonstrating that goats can be used to open up heavily scrub infested rangelands in the Cobar region, and give a reasonable financial return on the investment required in special fencing to confine them. The areas selected were dominated by scrub species acceptable to goats: 2 species in particular, narrow leaved hopbush (Dodonea [Dodonaea] attenuata) and the juvenile form of mulga (Acacia aneura), occur at spacings of 2-5 m, with mulga thickets often occupying large areas. These areas occur widely in shrub invaded poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea)/Acacia woodland across N. and W. New South Wales. Fencing and management of feral goats to encourage the return of grass and herbage species, and a continuing supply of young mulga browse, are described.

The samples were dehaired, and measurements made of down diameter and its distribution. These were compared with measurements made on composite samples drawn from the total fleece of each animal. Samples taken from the hip gave the most accurate estimate of down diameter of fleeces of av. diameter, but midside samples were better over the range of diameters exhibited by these goats. None of the sites was very suitable for estimating the diameter of extreme fibres, or the fibre diameter distribution. The repeatabilities of the various measurements were generally high. Production measurements recorded in 2yr from 20 of these goats show that diameter, yield and weight of down had high repeatabilities, but diameter distribution and length of down were not repeatable over years.&quot;  53.

Author's abstract:   &quot;The density of feral goats in about 234sqkm of arid rangeland used for sheep grazing in South Australia was estimated by means of a mark-resight technique. Marking and subsequent resighting were done at watering points. The Petersen estimate was 4.4 goats per square kilometre; adjustment to allow for non-random behaviour raised this estimate to 5.0/sqkm. Maximum allowable sheep density is 12/sqkm. The goat density we observed imposes an added burden on the vegetation. The densities of red and western grey kangaroos, when added together, approximate that of goats. Rabbits are virtually absent. The long-term effects of the total grazing pressure on the vegetation cannot be predicted in detail but will probably be deleterious.&quot;  Includes tables, graph, figures and bibliography.  73.

Of course, these people won't be attending the film festival like the average Joe. They'll waltz from limos, through lineups and into luxury hotels.  Reel Life was wondering just how far Toronto's service industry will go to show these thespians a good time. Impersonating the personal managers of Uma Thurman, Woody Allen and Sean Penn, Reel Life called some Toronto hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions to find out.  Surprisingly, Uma Thurman couldn't even get a reservation for a room at the Royal York. (We didn't get a chance to ask for a horse hair mattress.) And the SkyDome's PR director Howard Starkman said Woody Allen could not play ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" on the clarinet to open a Jays/Yankees game.  But Sean Penn's name opened doors very quickly at Bistro 990. This transcript of the phone call tells it all.  eye: Hi, I'm calling on behalf of Sean Penn. I'm trying to make a dinner reservation for him on the 16th of September for a group of 20 at 9:30 p.m. We'd like a room that is private.  990: Let me look at my book. He doesn't want to sit with the public downstairs?  eye: Absolutely not.  990: I could put him upstairs, yeah, I can give him a private room. Is 9:30 after his gala?  eye: Yes.   990: I have a second floor so nobody will see you.  eye: He's very sensitive -- he doesn't want any disruption. Especially not photographers .  990: Definitely not. That's a policy -- I don't get them in there. I'll have security guards at the door.  eye: We'd appreciate it if no one outside the immediate staff waiting on Mr. Penn would know that he's in the restaurant.   990: No one will know. We'll keep that very quiet. Andy Garcia came in today -- nobody knew.  eye: He'd like to screen a few of his outtakes from feature films. We'll need a projector and a small screen.  990: I do have a projector and a screen already in that room.  eye: In terms of menu... Sean had goat's-head soup while filming Casualties Of War in Malaysia. He talks about it all the time. Would you be able to do something along those lines?  990: I'll have to talk to the chef. (To the chef) Can you make... Sean Penn would like to have for dinner some goat head soup (sic)? The chef will look it up. We'll find out what that is.  eye: It's got a goat's head in it, apparently.  990: It sounds weird... but it could be tasty.  eye: Could you slaughter the goat during the salad?   990: Slaughter the goat in the salad? A real goat in the restaurant and slaughter it?  eye: Like they do in Japanese restaurants.  990: OK, I have... I have to check what it requires for me to have. To be more specific, you want the actual goat there, or...  eye: Two goats. Two goats. It takes one day to cook the goat in the soup. But I think he wants the appearance that the goat that was just slaughtered turns up in the soup.   990: Oh. I see.  eye: So you take the goat out, and sacrifice it and then take it away and come out and serve the soup with a goat's head in it. Like a cooking show, with one live goat in the dining room and a dead goat in the soup. I think he wanted that drama.  990: Literally pieces of the goat head?  eye: Not the goat head that was just slaughtered but the day before.  990: I don't think we can do that.  eye: So it would have to be pre-made?  990: We would have to look it up.  eye: He wanted to do something shocking. He's talking to studio heads. Is there any way to have a pi¤ata hung from the ceiling?  990: A real one?  eye: Papier-mch.  990: That I can probably get.  eye: We'd like it made in the shape of Madonna and filled with flies.  990: Filled with real flies? Alive?  eye: Live flies.   990: A papier-mch pi¤ata made in the shape of Madonna filled with live flies? I don't know. This is very confusing. What does he mean, the shape of Madonna?  eye: He wants Madonna the actress as opposed to Madonna the Virgin.   990: Madonna the singer in a pi¤ata. Does he want the face of Madonna?  eye: The whole body. It doesn't matter which era.   990: OK, I'll see what we can do. I'll see if we can find a local artist to make the pi¤ata. If the soup doesn't work we'll try something else. Other than that, are there any other requests you have?    Unfortunately, after the goat sacrifice and the Madonna pi¤ata we couldn't think of anything more bizarre, except maybe to ask if they had Prince Albert in a can. Anyhow, Bistro 990 phoned back to say that he couldn't do the goat sacrifice ""because I have parties afterwards and before.""   -30-        To eye 's Movie Features archives.

Dairy Goats are raised for goat milk. They also make good companions, go to petting zoos, and we show them at fairs.   Pygmy Goats are raised primarily for show. Like dairy goats, they are good companions, and they go to shows, fairs, and petting zoos.   Female goats are called does. Male goats are called bucks. We primarily raise does because they are easier to manage, they don't have an offensive odor (unlike bucks), and there are more shows for does. A male goat that has been neutered is known as a wether. We usually don't keep dairy goat wethers, but some kids raise and show pygmy wethers. Other domesticated goats include Boer goats that are starting to be raised for meat, Cashmere goats that are raised for cashmere and Nigerian Dwarf goats .

Goats are very affectionate and especially during the summer, when they are too hot to be active, they like to just hang around people and get a good scratch. Most goats' favorite scratchy spot is around their shoulder but some even liked to be scratched in between their toes. It is very rewarding to see a goat you have raised from a baby grow up and have kids and grandkids of her own. With goats that doesn't have too take too long, maybe about 3 or 4 years at most, because they are able to breed when they are just a year old. It's also neat to learn how to milk or trim hooves and other things that you wouldn't ordinarily be able to do.     Goat Statistics    Body Temperature: 102.5&#176 F-104&#176 F  Pulse/heart rate: 60 to 80 beats per minute  Respiration rate: 15 to 30 breaths per minute  Puberty: 4 to 12 months  Estrus (""heat"") cycle: 18 to 23 days  Length of each ""heat"": 12 to 36 hours  Gestation (length of pregnancy):  150 days   Breeding season:  Pygmy goats may be bred any time of the year. Dairy goats usually go into heat between August and January in the Northern Hemisphere.  Weight: An adult pygmy goat weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. An adult dairy goat doe weighs between 125 and 200 pounds. An adult dairy goat buck weighs between 200 and 300 pounds.      A healthy goat   Eyes clear and bright.  Tearing or cloudy eyes probably mean a pinkeye infection. Coat smooth and shiny.  A dull coat could indicate parasites. Fluffed up coat means the goat is not feeling well. Appetite good.  However, it is normal for a doe in labor to refuse to eat. Attitude alert.  Hunched back and droopy tail mean something is wrong.       Basic care  Like any other animal, a goat can survive without food for several days, but not without water. We provide automatic waterers in goat pens, and also leave a bucket of water. In some areas, of the country, its important to make sure the water doesn't freeze, but we don't have that problem.  Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a day and still have perfectly healthy goats. You will have to decide what is practical for your animal and your schedule.  Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be soiled by the goat.  The basic food we feed is alfalfa hay. An adult dairy goat doe eats about 1/2 flake a day (about 5 pounds). This is supplemented with a grain mixture that contains 14-16% protein depending on the additional needs of the goat:   Dairy doe in milk: 2-3 pounds  Pygmy doe in milk: 1-2 pounds  Dry doe: 0-1 pounds  Pregnant doe: (last 1-2 months) 1-2 pounds  Wethers: Usually given no grain.  We also provide either a loose mineral mix or a mineral brick. Since alfalfa hay is high in calcium, we make sure the mineral mix is high in phosphorous and low in calcium to maintain the proper calcium-to-phosphorous ratio.  Although this diet works for us, we suggest you consult with a local goat breeder or veterinarian who is more familiar with the nutritional needs of your goats and the nutritional value of the feed in your area.     Preventative health care  In our area, there are three types of injections that the goats need regularly: Tetanus toxiod, BoSe and a vacination for enterotoxemia. We give 1/2 cc. of tetanus toxiod yearly (usually one month before a doe is about to kid). BoSe contains selenium and vitamin E and is necessary to maintain muscle tone in adults and prevent ""white muscle disease"" in kids. Because hay in our area is low in Selenium, our goats receive 1 cc. of BoSe intramuscularly for every 40 pounds of body weight twice a year. The best time for bred does to receive BoSe is about one month before they kid and then 5 months after they kid. Babies should have their first injection at six weeks of age (1/2 cc), unless they need it sooner to correct a problem. For enterotoxemia the Clostridium Perfringens types C&D bacterin-toxoid vacination is given. It is often combined with a tetanus toxiod in brand names such as Bar-VAC CD/T or FERMACON CD/T. First course requires two doses at 21-28 days interval. The dose is 2ml SQ in the web of the elbow. Until recently yearly boosters were the norm, but vets are just now beginning to recommend twice yearly vaccinations. When using the combined CD/T it is not necessary to have a separate tetanus toxiod vaccine.   Check with a local vet to make sure goats in your area need selenium, and that the doses we use are appropriate for goats in your area and the brand of injectible you use. Overdoses of BoSe or injecting it to goats who receive selenium as part of their diet may be fatal. In your area, additional vaccines for other diseases may be necessary.   We deworm our goats twice yearly: in the fall before breeding and in the spring immediately following kidding. We use TBZ or paste wormers intended for horses ivermectin (Zimectrin) or pyrantel tartrate (Strongid C). Caution: check the label or ask your veterinarian whether the product can safely be given to a pregnant goat. Check labels for withdrawal time if you use the milk for human consumption.       Common Diseases   Coccidia are tiny intestinal parasites, actually protozoans, that can cause foamy, bloody diarrhea or a dull, dry coat. Sometimes a goat with coccidiosis (coccidia infestation) has an on-again-off-again soft stool or no obvious symptoms at all. You might not suspect a problem until you notice that your kids are not growing as well as they should. Young kids up to four months of age are at highest risk and should be treated at least once with the medication Albon. Our veterinarian recommends that they receive Albon for one week beginning at about three or four weeks of age and again if they are very stressed, such as when separated from their mother. If in doubt, take a stool sample to a veterinarian who regularly treats goats.    Ketosis (also known as pregnancy toxemia) may occur in pregnant does late in their pregnancy. The doe may be depressed, weak, uninterested in food, and have poor muscle control and balance.  If untreated, death follows within a few days. Early in the disease, many does will show a positive test for ketone bodies in the urine.  Ketosis may occur when the doe is carrying two or more kids, or when the doe is very fat. This disease is caused by the sudden extra demand for energy by the fast-growing kids in the pregnant goat and the inability of the goat to eat enough of her normal diet to provide this energy (due to the kids taking up room in the body). The doe will rapidly metabolize fat from her body stores produces ketones (a toxic by-product) and the symptoms of the disease. Treatment with propylene glycol at two to three ounces twice a day will help. If the doe lies down and cannot stand, treatment is usually not successful unless she delivers at that time.   As a preventive measure, do not let the doe get fat early in pregnancy and in the last month of pregnancy provide 1-2 pounds of grain in addition to hay.      Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Syndrome  (CAE) is a viral disease. In young kids symptoms include a weakness in the rear legs, with no fever, or loss of appetite, However,  the unused legs lose muscle strength and structure and the infected kids eventually die.  In older goats, the same disease is seen as swollen joints, particularly the knees.  The disease develops slowly, and after 2 or more years, the animal has difficulty using its legs properly.  Infected goats have no fever, remain alert, and eat well. However, they do not recover from the arthritis.  An inexpensive blood tests can be used to diagnose CAE. The disease is spread from older infected goats to kids, perhaps by contact or through the milk from an infected doe to her kid. There are no corrective procedures or treatments. Isolating kids at birth and raising them on pasteurized goat milk is done to prevent the spread. It's a good idea to make sure a goat is CAE free before purchasing. However, the blood test only checks for antibodies, and it's possible that an animal is infected and not (yet) producing antibodies.   Mastitis  is an inflammation of the mammary gland (udder or milk-giving gland) of animals, usually caused by bacteria. The symptoms of mastitis are heat, pain, and swelling of the udder. Usually you will notice some discoloration of the tissue and abnormal milk.  The infected udder will change in color from slightly more pink to a bright red, or to a black and cold udder. The milk from an infected udder will vary in color, texture, and thickness.  The California Mastitis Test (CMT) is a good test for subclinical mastitis, but is not 100% accurate. Laboratory culture or growth of the bacteria causing the mastitis is the best way to determine the exact diagnosis.   The causes of mastitis are most commonly rough treatment and unclean milking practices. Wash the goat's udder before milking, and dip (or spray) the teats after milking with a teat dip. Wash your hands before milking each goat to prevent the spread. The treatment consists of an intramammary infusion of antibiotics, sometimes accompanied by additional antibiotics. Consulting a vet is important for this disease since there are many different bacteria that cause mastitis and different antibiotics are best for each. If untreated the infection spreads and the goat may die or lose the udder.      Breeding  A dairy goat should weigh at least 80 pounds and be at least 8 months old the first time she is bred. A pygmy goat should be between 9 and 18 months and a good size for her age. In order for the doe to conceive (become pregnant), she must be in estrus (""heat"" or ""season"".) Signs of estrus include flagging (wagging her tail), mucous discharging from her rear, mounting other goats, and excited behavior if she is near a buck. At first, you'll probably breed your does to a buck of a local breeder, but eventually, you might want to consider owning your own buck or artificial insemination . A good indication that a doe is pregnant is that it does not come into heat on its next cycle, so check your goat carefully three weeks after breeding. It may be hard to determine if a dairy goat is pregnant if it was bred at the end of the breeding season.     Labor  The expected due date  is 150 days after breeding. A few weeks before delivery, the goat's udder will usually become enlarged. A day or two before birth, the udder often fills up and the pelvic ligaments at the base of the tail relax so that the tail feels loose. Frequent urination and low pitched bleating are also signs that labor will begin within a day or two. The first sign we usually notice that indicates that labor is imminent is the discharge of the mucous plug, followed by small amounts of mucous. In our experience, this usually occurs an hour or two before birth.  In the uterus, the kid is enclosed in an amniotic sac which is surrounded by a water sac. Usually the water sac bursts 30 minutes to 2 hours before the delivery of the first kid. The amniotic sac might burst a few minutes before delivery. Usually, a kid will be born front legs and head first, and no assistance is needed. In multiple births, each kid is usually delivery 5-30 minutes after the previous sibling, and the placenta is expelled a few hours later.     If the kids haven't arrived within two hours after the water sac breaks, or if the kid is not positioned properly, an experienced goat breeder or a veterinarian might be required to assist in the delivery by repositioning the kid or ""pulling"" the kid out.     Care of newborn goats  Usually, the doe will lick the kid, to remove mucous and to stimulate its breathing. With a weak kid or inattentive mother, you might want to make sure the kid is freed from the amniotic sac and the mouth and nose are free of mucous. It is not necessary to cut the umbilical cord, but if there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord of the kid, we tie it with dental floss. Within an hour of birth, we dip the umbilical cord in 7% iodine to prevent infections.  Usually within a half hour, the kids will attempt to stand and nurse. It is important that the kids nurse within the first few hours of birth to receive colostrum which provides immunoglobulins.  Before the kids reach ten days old, they are dehorned. Before dehorning, we administer tetanus antitoxin to provide temporary protection against tetanus. Often at the time of dehorning male kids are castrated (also known as wethered). At one month of age, we usually give tetanus toxiod (repeated one month later for newborns) and BoSe. The BoSe is repeated every six months and the tetanus toxiod is repeated yearly.       Cost of raising a goat  Here are the approximate costs of items needed for raising a goat:   Purchase price: Expect to pay between $100 and $300 for a registered Dairy Goat kid and between $150 and $350 for a Pygmy Goat.  Feed: The cost of alfalfa hay in Southern California varies between $9 and $12 per bale, depending on the season and the feed store. Grain costs about $9 per 50 pound bag. One mature dairy goat eats approximately 1 bale of hay every 2 weeks  Supplies:  Collar $6 Insecticide powder	$7  Hoof trimmers	$14 Milking bucket	$20 - $30 Grooming brush	$4 Kid nipples	60 cents  Medications:  Tetanus antitoxin	$2 for vial for three kids Worming medication	$8 - $15 for 10 to 20 doses   Procedures:  Stud service	$25 to $75 Disbudding	$10 at Farm; $35 with a vet CAE blood test	$6 Stool sample	$12 to $16 through a veterinarian      Sources of Goat Supplies   Specializing in the Goat  Caprine Supply P.O.

7,"   Kaldi &amp; the Dancing Goats     Kaldi &amp; the Dancing Goats There are many versions of how coffee came to be but by far the most famous is that of Kaldi &amp; the Dancing Goats. ""Once upon a time in the land of Arabia Felix, there lived a goatherd named Kaldi. Kaldi was a sober responsible goatherd whose goats were also sober, if not responsible. One night, Kaldi's goats didn't come home, and in the morning he found them dancing with abandoned glee near a shiny, dark-leafed shrub with red berries. Kaldi soon determined that it was the red berries on the shiny, dark-leafed shrub that caused the goats' eccentric behavior, and it wasn't long before he was dancing too. Finally, a learned imam from a local monastery came by, sleppily, no doubt, on his way to prayer. He saw the goats dancing, Kaldi dancing, and the shiny, dark-leafed shrub with the red berries. Being of a more systematic turn of mind that the goats or Kaldi, the learned imam subjected the red berries to various experimental examinations, one of which involved parching and boiling. Soon neither the imam nor his fellows fell asleep at prayers, and the use of coffee spread from monastery to monastery, throughout Arabia Felix, and from there to the rest of the world.""

42,"  Animals I Have Known   A pictorial tour of some of the animals  (and people) in my life  These are the first scans of these images. Soon, I'll be coming back to clean them up and make them a bit smaller so that all the poor people like me who only have SLIP connections don't have to spend so long waiting for the pictures come in.   I know it's just a boring, cliche`, dog picture to the rest of you but to my brother and I, this dog had so much character I had to put him in. Sadly, Kodiak is no longer with us.   In this picture, we see my first dog, Patches, being very patient with my younger brother, Jason. Jason is the one on the right and yes, that is a banana peel on the dog's head.   This is a goat we met in Amsterdam. No other goats to be found. No other animals of any kind. We weren't on a farm; in fact, we were just on our way to a tulip nursery. Apparently, goats just roam free on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Who says travel isn't broadening?   Of course every university seems to have animals or statues of some sort that yell/roar/ring/etc. when freshmen/virgins/coeds/etc. walk by. At  Purdue University , these are the lions that roar when virgins go by. Of course, to alums the most enduring symbol of the University was the old smokestack which was torn down the year after I graduated. I don't have any pictures of the smokestack so the lions will have to do in its absence.   I met this goose while I was working at  Argonne National Labs . Argonne is on a nature preserve and is very picturesque. Known more to the outside residents for its unique herd of albino deer and to the interns for its Evil and Agressive Swans , the only pictures I seem to have are of the geese. Go figure!   People are some of my favorite animals. The original of this photo just might be my favorite out of all those I've ever taken. I caught these kids at a swim meet in Greenwood, IN. I was coaching at the time but during the break between the morning and afternoon sessions the pool was mostly deserted and I was able to take a few pics of these girls in natural, childlike play.

53,"   Arthur's Column    Arthur's Column  Of goats and men ...   Week ending 20th August 1995.   Firstly, thank you to Gabriel for handling the gruelling task of writing this column for the past three weeks. As you will have noticed, Gabriel is a talented writer who rose to this task with admirable liquidity. His other work can be perused in The Column Nobody Reads...  Which brings me to the theme of this week's column. What, you may ask, have goats to do with merriment and London. Well, the answer is lies in the former. Last week I was fortunate to be in Liechtenstein for their annual holiday (held appropriately on the birthday of the local prince), and am now able to report on some of the antics that occured.  Getting plastered appears to be the principal feature of the day (along with bands, a fair etc.), and yours truly rose to the occasion together with various friends who happened to be there. What started out as an innocent few pints rapidly degenerated into a rather decent party. It is on what happened under the cover of darkness, however, that your columnist must report.  There is this field. It has four goats. Not large ones, rather the cute brown type that one stops to pat on one's morning run. In fact, one had stopped and patted said goats that very morning. Which lead to the statement sometime later that day ... ""Wonder what the goats will look like in London Mall T Shirts"" (we had a few). Not thinking more about it the day drew to its predictable close and I retired to bed. A little later some of the younger members of the crew appeared at the house.  ""Got to come and see the goats!"" .  You guessed it. Four cute brown goats dressed in T Shirts. This is where the fun started.  Sensing the farmer's imminent disapproval wifey instructed said crew members to remove said T Shirts. An easy task, you would think, particularly for such experienced goat dressers as these. What they hadn't counted on was the arrival of one very large non-cute billy goat who, leaping the electric fence with ease, took control of the paddock, T Shirts, crew members, goats and all. By taking control you can infer ""asserted authority"". Within seconds the team were scrabbling down 30 foot drops where even goats are smart enough not to tread. Battered and bruised they repaired to the house, wondering whether the Billy could negotiate the complex Swiss locks on the front door.  On more local issues I went to the  Anchor Bankside  today for a pint and lunch. I have written about this pub before - singing its praises etc. I now have to rescind everything. There are lots of tables outside where you can sit and enjoy a great view of the Thames, obscured only by the back of a 4 foot banner proclaiming the pub's presence to the river. Unfortunately the tables are dirty, and the area is not kept clean. Inside, the queue for lunch at 14.00 was long and very slow. After spending the obligatory 30 minutes waiting to be served by unenthusiastic bar staff the food is virging on the inedible.  Its a real shame that a pub with such heritage, clearly on the tourist maps, has become such a poor example of a British pub.  Speaking of pubs, on my pub-crawl towards home yesterday afternoon I had the opportunity to stop in at  Dogget's Coat and Badge  on the south side of the Thames just west of Blackfriar's bridge. Not worthy of a visit, I shall grade it 1 in the Pub Guide . I also had occasion to visit  The Founders Arms  on the South bank just east of Blackfriars. This is a reasonable pub, worthy of a 4. It has a great view of the river, but is unfortunately very modern looking and rather boring architecturally. Worth a pint just for the view though.  Thats all for now...

60,"   Katya Reimann's Visual Work    VISUAL WORK    The plan is for this to be a revolving gallery of my paintings and drawings, with occasional updates when I have produced new work that is good enough to dicker about with and get scanned in.   New! A sketchbook of black wash watercolors from a monthlong trip I took to India in December 1993.    Sketchbook of India Watercolors                                          Life scenes    Influenced by Edward Hopper, this depicts a beach house after a huge storm along the coast.    This gate led down into a garden that I never got to go into.    I did a series of paintings of the small plastic animals that I'd grown up with as a child. My motivation for this was wanting to paint animals that cast shadows and not having the mobility to go out to a zoo.    'Chinese Generals' I painted this at the same time I was taking a course in Chinese Art History and learning about how the Chinese painters used animals and other images drawn from nature to express political parables. The instructor caught my attention with a story about two Chinese generals at the time of the Mongol invasion (c. 1272). One ended up collaborating with the invaders, the other relinquished all his titles and wealth and went up into the mountains to herd goats. A well-known master painter illustrated this with a simple brush drawing of a sheep and a goat, the animals symbolizing the respective spirits of these generals. I painted a lot of bad paintings of sheep and goats before I managed to get this one good one. Whether or not it ended up being anything about Chinese generals is another story....    Fantasy Images    This was my Christmas card one year when I was still stubborn enough to try to color cards up for all my friends.    The inspiration for this was an Italian hill town, but I think it does suggest stepping into a far off city in a fantastic world.    This is my King and Queen of Cups. The poses are nicked from the card that symbolizes 'The Lovers' in the fifteenth century Visconti Tarot deck. She carries the magic cup that wells up with its own source of water; He carries the magic cup that is the stuff of the seas--when he ruffles the water within the cup, a storm appears upon the seas...

""If you make the wolves the &gt; &gt; guardians of the sheep, it will turn them into sheep dogs."" There is little evidence to show that people with experience breaking into computer systems have any particular talent for protecting them. A few may have some specific insights, and a rare few may have general background, but that is not the general case. For instance, being able to guess someone's password doesn't mean someone is able to design a cryptographic algorithm to protect passwords; and being able to exploit a race condition doesn't mean one knows how to write effective code without them. It's also the case that sheepdogs that ever stray and kill a lamb must themselves be put down. Once they've been a sheep killer, there is no way to ever trust them not to do it again -- the temptation might be too much for them on another occasion. Ask a shepherd. --spaf       Next message:  John Hawkinson: ""Re: [8lgm]-Advisory-7.UNIX.passwd.11-May-1994""   Previous message:  Gene Spafford: ""Re: [8lgm]-Advisory-7.UNIX.passwd.11-May-1994""   In reply to:  Timothy Newsham: ""wolves and sheep on the inet""    Next in thread:  Steve Simmons: ""Re: wolves and sheep on the inet""  ",Sheep

48,"   Black Sheep Writing Contest Invitation     Invitation and Announcement   Black Sheep Writing Contest Sponsored by the Colorado Genealogical Society .   The Colorado Genealogical Society invites you to compete for its Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence. Our purpose is to provide an opportunity for you to apply your writing and documenting skills to ""black sheep"" genealogical subject matter. We seek originality in choice, treatment, and presentation of subject matter as well as the achievement of excellence in writing and documentation.   Your choice of subject is important. Black Sheep is defined as ""a person considered undesirable or disgraceful by his family or group."" Your subject need not be related to your family. All subjects in your paper must have died prior to 1930. Here are some examples of topics: genealogy of the ownership of a bordello which made your city/family/state notorious; a wild and woolly ancestor of yours, of a friend, or of no one you know; an unusual past owner of the house you live in; an introduction to a compilation of the infamous such as to an index of markers in a ""boot hill cemetery"" or a jail (the compilation need not be a part of the entry); a religious heretic, or a devout Christian in a family of heretics.   Entries will be judged on such criteria as: originality in choice and treatment of subject matter; writing style (technique and approach in presenting subject); depth of research; evaluation of evidence; quality of source material used to document evidence; and writing mechanics (form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, documentation).   The Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence will be presented for overall superior quality in written presentation. In addition, citations for excellence may be awarded for special recognition of originality, writing style, documentation, or technique.   Judges for the 1996 Contest    Guest Judge, Helen F. M.

58,"   Sheep - VegSocUK Information Sheet    The Vegetarian Society UK  Sheep  Information Sheet      Introduction -- Sheep Production -- Transport & Slaughter -- Mulesing and Tooth-Grinding -- Wool     Introduction  There are around 44 million sheep in the UK national flock including about 50 pure breeds and 300 crossbreeds. Over 22 million are lambs under one year of age whilst 17 million are breeding ewes. Most sheep are slaughtered as lambs.  Whilst sheep appear to have been less affected by intensive farming practices compared with other farm animals their rearing can still involve considerable suffering and welfare problems.    Sheep Production  Ewes are first mated in their first or second years. Ewes naturally come into heat in autumn or winter and gestation period is about five months meaning lambs are born in spring or summer when the weather is warmer and grass is growing. However this can be altered by controlled breeding with ewes being brought into heat by administering hormones. This means lambs can be born throughout the year providing a constant supply to market.  Rams are usually from special breeding farms. A single ram will usually serve 30 to 60 ewes. Artificial insemination is uncommon in sheep though new techniques are being developed to make it more efficient.  Ewes generally lamb once per year though selective breeding has meant some can lamb twice per year. Breeding has also encouraged ewes to have twins or triplets rather than a single lamb. If a ewe has only a single lamb the unborn lamb may grow too large to pass through the narrow birth canal, sheep having been bred to be smaller. Many farmers may choose to cut the front legs off the live lamb whilst still in the womb. This is called embryotomy and is carried out to avoid having to pay a vet to perform a caesarean. The practice is widespread and more than 50,000 lambs are believed to be killed in this manner during the lambing season.  Around 4 million lambs die each year. Exposure, hypothermia, starvation and disease account for most of these. Sometimes there may be too many lambs in the flock (due to multiple births or the death of ewes.) These orphan lambs may be auctioned at markets at only a few days old. These lambs are especially prone to disease and mortality is high. 35,000 orphan lambs are sent to market during the lambing season.  A trend towards intensification means lambs are weaned earlier, fed on milk substitute and feed concentrates and housed indoors. Indoor housing has lead to increasing disease problems including coccidiosis, watery mouth and sheep lice.  Male lambs are castrated before three months old. The commonest method is by the application of a tight rubber ring cutting off the blood supply. Castration can occur without anaesthetic in lambs up to three months provided the ring is applied within the first week of life. The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) stated in 1992 that castration by means of a rubber ring causes considerably greater pain than the alternative clamping method which is sometimes used. Acute pain lasts for several hours following application of the ring. Sometimes castration may be performed surgically using a knife. Again, this can be carried out without anaesthetic or a vet being present. Tail docking of lambs may also occur without anaesthetic.  Between 15-25% of ewes are culled each year because of lameness, poor health or failing to lamb. These are replaced in the flock. Flock stocking densities are steadily increasing. This is causing environmental problems in upland areas as overgrazing by sheep leads to loss of vegetation and soil erosion.  In common with other farm animals, sheep suffer from a wide range of diseases. The commonest is foot-rot which often results in lameness. Foot-rot is encouraged by a high stocking density in housing and pens. Lameness can also be caused by other infectious diseases and is a major welfare problem in sheep.  Sheep scab and myiasis (blowfly strike) are distressing and potentially fatal contagious diseases in sheep. These are prevented by sheep dipping. Sheep dipping was made compulsory twice a year in 1985 but made non-compulsory again in 1992. Sheep dips contain toxic organophosphates which are believed to be responsible for a high incidence of severe illness in farmers. The possible toxic effects of sheep dips on the sheep themselves has not been studied.  Other diseases affecting sheep include mastitis, toxoplasmosis, liver fluke and scrapie (related to BSE in cattle). Many sheep suffer from pneumonia and hypothermia during the winter when exposed to harsh weather conditions. This is a particular problem for sheep in upland areas. Around 40% of sheep in the UK live in hard upland conditions where winter hand feeding is restricted and shelter minimal.  Some sheep are housed indoors during the winter in enclosed sheds or barns. These may be poorly lit with concrete or slatted floors.    Transport & Slaughter  Sheep may be transported considerable distances to slaughter. Over 1.3 million sheep and lambs were exported live in 1992 and this figure is predicted to increase to between 2.5 and 3.5 million in 1993. 82% of live sheep are exported to France.  Sheep are crammed into lorries so tightly packed that they may be unable to turn around or lie down. They may be exposed to extreme weather conditions. Heatstroke, hypothermia and pneumonia are common. Journeys can last 24 hours or more during which time the sheep are neither fed or watered. This is extremely distressing for the animals and mortality is high.  In Britain, most sheep go to slaughter via markets rather than direct from the farm. This can increase the stress animals experience as well as increasing the incidence of injury. Over 19 million sheep were slaughtered in the UK in 1992. Over 90% of these were lambs of varying ages.  Sheep are slaughtered by electrical stunning followed by neck-cutting. Stunning may often be ineffective and sheep may regain consciousness during bleeding-out or even before throat-slitting. Stunning by firing a captive bolt into the animals head is regarded as a more effective method but is not often used in British abattoirs due to being more costly.    Mulesing and Tooth-Grinding  Mulesing and tooth-grinding of sheep is prohibited in the UK but is widespread elsewhere, especially in Australia and New Zealand. Much of the lamb consumed and wool used in Britain is imported from these countries.  Australia is the world's leading sheep producer and exporter with a national flock of an estimated 135 million sheep. Mortality is high, at around 8 million sheep per year. Around 100 million sheep suffer from mulesing each year. Mulesing involves the slicing away of folds of skin from beneath the sheep's tail which forms a wool-free scar and so prevents blowfly strike (blowflies laying their eggs in the damp wool and the larvae eating into the flesh of the living sheep). This is carried out without anaesthetic and causes severe and prolonged pain. Mulesing is carried out because it is seen as being cheaper and easier than alternatives such as regular shearing of wool.  Tooth-grinding of older sheep is also routine. Tooth-grinding is supposed to reduce the number of ewes prematurely culled due to broken teeth. It involves a rotary stone cutting machine to slice off the ewe's front teeth through the pulp almost down to the gum. In the UK, tooth-grinding was carried out by a less severe method involving shortening the front teeth with less likelihood of cutting through sensitive tissue. However, this practice is now illegal in the UK.    Wool  Wool production in the UK tends to be a by-product of the meat industry, the wool produced being of low quality. Wool accounts for 5-10% of the total value of a ewe. Most British wool is used for coarse fabrics such as carpets. Wool production in Britain was 72 million kg in 1992.  Sheep are first sheared at around 14 months old. Lambs of some breeds may be clipped to provide lambswool. The entire fleece is sheared in one piece. Sheep have been selectively bred to produce a thick fleece and need to be sheared in early summer to prevent heatstroke. Wild sheep do not need to be sheared.  Nearly one-third of British wool is from slaughtered sheep (mostly lambs). This is called skin wool. Skins from lambs also provide high value leather.

26,"    The Sheepeaters: Indians of Yellowstone   The Sheepeaters: Keepers of the Past    When the first white men visited Yellowstone in the early nineteenth century, a group of reclusive Shoshone-speaking Indians known as the Sheepeaters inhabited the Plateau. They had neither guns nor horses and lived a stone-age lifestyle, hunting the Rocky Mountain Bighorn sheep for food and clothing. Modern Archeology and Anthropology along with first-hand accounts of trappers and explorers help to tell the story of The Sheepeaters: Keepers of the Past.  This is a video for people of all ages that reveals the story of prehistoric Indians living in Yellowstone before it became the world's first National Park. Vivid illustrations by Delores Dinsmore and authoritative narration by Dr. Les Davis of the Museum of the Rockies bring alive the story of these Native Americans.

Sheep, common name for a collection of grazing mammals that may be either wild or domesticated; the domesticated varieties are the most widely distributed kind of domestic animal, found in nearly all countries. Wild species are found in some areas of the world: the bighorn in western North America; Dall sheep in northern Canada and Alaska; the mouflon in Mediterranean countries; the Asian mouflon in western Asia; the urial in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and the argali in eastern Asia. Sheep were probably domesticated about 11,000 years ago in what is now northern Iraq, and they are thought to have descended primarily from the mouflon, although recent evidence suggests that species such as the Asian mouflon contributed to some of the modern breeds.

45,"   Blade Runner / Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  What Book is  Based on?  Blade Runner is loosely based on a  Philip K. Dick : Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ( DADoES ). The least one can say about the film adaptation is that it borrowed a number of concepts and characters from the book. Dick also wrote the short story that  Total Recall  was based on, We Can Remember It For You, Wholesale . A recurring theme in Dick's work is the question of personal and human identity.  A question explored more in DADoES and Total Recall than in Blade Runner is ""what is reality?""  You are most likely to find DADoES in a second-hand bookstore. It has been re-printed as: Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) .  The title comes from Alan E. Nourse, who wrote a story called The Bladerunner .  William S. Burroughs took the book and wrote Bladerunner (A Movie) in 1979. Rights to the title only (""in perpetuity"") were sold to  Ridley Scott . Similarities between Nourse's The Bladerunner and Scott's Blade Runner are in name only. Nourse's title refers to people who deliver medical instruments to outlaw doctors who can't obtain them legally. Scott thought the title made a good codename for Deckard.  Some of the ""visuals"" were inspired by a story from  Dan O'Bannon and Moebius ( Jean Giraud ) called  The Long Tomorrow  in an issue of the French Wonders of the Universe comic book series. The back of the comic book says (translated from French):     This comic-book also contains other famous stories,    like ""The Long Tomorrow"", which originally was thought    to be a parody, but ended up being more real, than what    it was meant to be a parody of: the classic American    detective-story. This story was later used as a visual    reference for the movie ""Blade Runner.""  Giraud did the costume design for the Walt Disney movie Tron , for which  Syd Mead did the mechanical design.

2," Doug Hogue's Sheep Page      Douglas E. Hogue          Two limitations of sheep production are the reproductive rates of ewes and the seasonality of production. The STAR sheep management system has been developed to help solve these two problems. It is a systematic schedule with 5 lambing periods evenly spaced throughout the year for continuity of production. Each ewe can lamb 5 times in 3 years or 1.67 times a year for increased production. Coupling this increase in lambing frequency with an increased lambing rate, we are now realizing an annual lamb production of about 3 lambs per ewe.

66,"   Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham     Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham  From The News , Portsmouth, England, April 28, 1995.  Protesters hail intervention near Brighton a victory.  Police stopped a lorry carrying live animal exports bound for Shoreham Harbour today and ordered the driver not to try to reach the port.  It was the first lorry to be halted following the decision by Sussex Police to limit police escorts for exporters.  As hundreds of protesters gathered at the port today, a lorry from Cheltenham carrying sheep was halted six miles away near Brighton.  The shippers, International Traders Ferries, are believed to have sent the lorry to test the resolve of the police.  ITF's director Bill Ford was with the lorry as it was pulled over by Chief Inspector Kelly McCartney and the driver warned not to continue.  A video cameraman, believed to be with ITF, filmed the incident while a Ministry of Agriculture vet inspected the 176 sheep and passed them fit.  A spokesman for the lorry owners, G G Gilder, of Cheltenham, Gloucs. said the load was bound for Shoreham.  He said in Cheltenham ""I will be extremely annoyed if one of my lorries which is roadworthy and fully insured has been stopped on the Queen's highway for whatever reason.""  Demonstrators at the port hailed the latest incident in the four-month battle to halt animal shipments to France as a triumph.  One said: ""We are absolutely delighted.

Also, we are  &gt;basically conservative beings and tend to believe that whatever we saw first  &gt;is right, original, proper, etc. and any subsequent variation is wrong,  &gt;derivative, heresy, etc. (In other words, I have no idea whether I believe  &gt;it simply because it is something I believe.)  &gt;  &gt;I haven't made any real effort to hunt this down, so don't go to any trouble,  &gt;but if someone can answer this easily, I'd appreciate it.  &gt;  &gt;Thanks,  &gt;  &gt;Gunnar  &gt;  &gt;Gunnar Swanson Design Office  &gt;739 Indiana Avenue, Venice, California 90291-2728 USA  &gt;310/399-5191 fax:310/399-2675  &gt;  &gt;                   |||                  (0-0) oOO-*-*-*-*-*(_)  | Peter D.

It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the misapprehension that  they're birds.  Observe their be'avior. Take for a start the sheeps' tendency to 'op  about the field on their 'ind legs.  Now witness their attmpts to fly from tree to  tree.  Notice that they do not so much fly as...plummet.    Tourist: Yes, but why do they think they're birds?  Shepherd: Another fair question.  One thing is for sure, the sheep is not a creature of the air.  They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin'.   Trouble is, sheep are very dim.  Once they get an idea in their 'eads, there's no  shiftin' it.  Tourist: But where did they get the idea?  Shepherd: From Harold.  He's that most dangerous of creatures, a clever sheep. 'e's realized  that a sheep's life consists of standin' around for a few months and then bein' eaten.  And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep.

Sheep will be retested   upon arrival by LAR using elisa technique.   No women of childbearing years will work with the sheep.    Technicians will be assigned to the sheep which will be housed   in the large animal cubicle.  The room will remain locked during the day and will be signed with ""Restricted Entry"".   Technicians will care for the sheep as the last duty of the   day. The use of masks is strongly recommended. Technicians   will launder the uniforms each day and wipe shoes with a   bleach solution. Technicians should shower prior to leaving   the facility.   The animals will be housed on raised wire caging. The pens   will be hosed down daily by a technician wearing LAR provided   uniforms, disposable gloves, shoes that remain at the animal   facility.   Contaminated surfaces will be disinfected with 1:100 dilution   of household chlorine bleach that contains 5.25% hypochlorite.   The animals will be fed alfalfa cubes rather than hay to   minimize potential contamination. The sheep will be sheared   prior to purchase. Male sheep or non pregnant females will be   used.   Medical Monitoring Procedures:  No individual will work with   sheep without a current serum reference sample on file, as   well as having met all other requirements of the Medical   Monitoring Program.   A training session to inform the affected LAR staff of the   potential hazards of Q-fever and the symptoms most often   associated with the illness will be provided.   Personnel will be advised to seek medical attention if they   develop a febrile illness compatible with that of Q-fever .

52,"    Desert Bighorn Sheep       Desert Bighorn Sheep   . . . . . Ovis canadensis mexicana    SIZE: Length of adult ram, 50 inches; weight, 200 lbs.   RANGE: Western and southern Arizona; Chihuahua and Sonora Mexico.   HABITAT: Rocky ridges and buttes.   DIET: Herbivore; grasses, herbs, shrubs, cactus and cactus fruit.   LIFE SPAN: 15 - 20 years.   STATUS: Once protected because of loss of habitat from human invasion and competition with domestic and exotic animals. Population now increasing and being reintroduced into former ranges.    ADAPTATIONS:    ANATOMY: Both sexes have horns. The female's horns are slimmer and shorter than the massive curled horns of the ram. SENSES: Good peripheral and depth vision allows it to move over mountainsides without falling, and to maintain allaround surveillance of the area. LOCOMOTION: The outer edge of the hoof is hard and enables the sheep to stand on the tiniest projection. The sole is soft and rubberlike, which helps it to cling to smooth surfaces and cushion the impact when jumping. HABITS: The ram uses his horns in fighting for breeding rights. Horns may also be used to obtain food and as a defense against predators. DEFENSE: Escapes into inaccessible rocky areas and fights with horns as weapon. SOCIAL UNIT: Males live in separate herds from the females and the last year's young. At the start of the breeding season, the males fight for harems, and then, with their females, separate into new herds until that season is over. MISC.: The Desert Bighorn can go without drinking water for extended periods. It relies on the moisture in vegetation, especially cactus.

39,"    Wool Manufacturing: Shear Pain    Miscellaneous #6   Wool Manufacturing: Shear Pain       Many people believe that shearing sheep helps animals who might otherwise be burdened with too much wool. But without human interference, sheep grow just enough wool to protect themselves from temperature extremes. The fleece provides effective insulation against both cold and heat. Until shears were invented in 1000 B.C., the only way to obtain wool was to ""pluck"" sheep during molting seasons. Breeding for continuous growth began after the advent of shears.(1)  Death ""Down Under""  With an estimated 148 million sheep, Australia produces eighty percent of all wool used worldwide. Flocks usually consist of thousands of sheep, and individual attention to their needs is virtually impossible.  Just weeks after birth, lambs' ears are punched, their tails are chopped off, and males are castrated without anesthetic. According to Australian Law Reform Chairman, M.D. Kirby, Australian sheep suffer over 50 million operations a year that would constitute cruelty if performed on dogs or cats.(8) Extremely high rates of mortality are considered ""normal"": 20-40 percent of lambs die at birth or before the age of eight weeks from cold or starvation; eight million mature sheep die every year from disease, lack of shelter, and neglect. One million of these die within 30 days of shearing.(6)  In Australia, the most commonly raised sheep are Merinos, specifically bred to have wrinkly skin (which means more wool per animal). This unnatural overload of wool causes animals to die of heat exhaustion during hot months, and the wrinkles also collect urine and moisture. Attracted to the moisture, flies lay eggs in the folds of skin, and the hatched maggots can literally eat sheep alive. To prevent ""flystrike,"" Australian ranchers perform a barbarous operation--""mulesing""--or carving huge strips of skin off the backs of unanesthetized lambs' legs. This is done to cause smooth, scarred skin that won't harbor fly eggs. Yet the bloody wounds often get flystrike before they heal; and despite the feeling by many that mulesing may kill more sheep than it saves, the mutilation continues.(10)   Aging sheep are subjected to ""tooth-grinding,"" an unanesthetized procedure that sheep farmers claim reduces tooth loss and extends the sheep's productive life. A battery-operated grinder is used to wear down the teeth. Another method involves using the edge of a disc cutter to cut right through the teeth near the level of the gums. This terrifying and painful procedure exposes the sensitive pulp cavities inside and causes the teeth to bleed profusely.(9)  Faced with such vast amounts of death and disease, the rational step would be to reduce the numbers of sheep so as to maintain the existing ones decently. Instead, sheep are forced to bear more lambs by the administration of drugs. Malnourished ewes are taken into laboratories and placed in climate-controlled chambers to determine how much exposure they can withstand before they die.(7)  Like other ""commodities,"" animals can fall victim to fluctuations in the economy. In 1990, 10 million Australian sheep were shot and buried in mass graves when they became practically valueless due to a lingering drought and low wool prices.  Shear Torture  Sheep are sheared each spring, after lambing, just before they would naturally shed their winter coats. Timing is critical: shearing too late means loss of wool. In the rush, an estimated one million Australian sheep die every year of exposure after premature shearing. A closely shorn sheep is, in fact, more sensitive to cold than a naked man since a sheep's normal body temperature is about 102 degrees F, much higher than a human's.(2)  When shearing, speed is everything. Shearers are usually paid by volume, not by hour, which encourages working quickly and carelessly. Says one eyewitness: ""the shearing shed must be one of the worst places in the world for cruelty to animals. I have seen shearers punch sheep with their shears or fists until the sheep's noses bled. I have seen sheep with half their faces shorn off.""  Live Export  When the sheep age and are no longer effective wool producers, they are transported long distances to slaughterhouses in trucks and trains without food or water. Those who fall are trampled by other frightened animals. On arrival, the dead and dying are piled into heaps. Those with foot rot attempt to drag themselves on their knees.(11)  The ultimate cruelty is the live export of seven million sheep every year from Australia to the Middle East, which the Wool Council of Australia supports as ""an important component of the wool and sheep industry."" These sheep travel vast distances until they reach the feedlots where they are held before being loaded onto ships. Many sheep, ill or wounded from the journey, faced with intensive crowding, disease, and strange food, die in the holding pens. Eighteen percent of sheep die during the 3-6 week transport process; in just one Australian feedlot, 15,000 sheep died from cold in 1983.(12)  The surviving sheep--7 million a year--are herded onto huge 14-tier-high ships resembling the old slave-trade ships. Up to 125,000 sheep are packed tightly into each ship, each allocated an area hardly bigger than themselves, so that not all can lie down at once, or reach the feed troughs. Mired in their own waste for three weeks or more, the sheep suffer from sea-sickness, temperature extremes, disease, and injuries. Younger animals or babies born en route are often trampled to death. Shipboard mortality ranges up to 10 percent, and for every sheep who dies, many others become ill and are injured.(13)  When the three-week trip to the Middle East is over, the surviving sheep are killed in ritual slaughter (Halal). Since Moslem religious law does not require that the knife be sharpened between kills, sheep often have their throats sawed open with dull knives. According to one witness in the Sitra abbatoir in Bahrain, men would begin slaughtering as soon as a pen was full. The sheep would ""wave their heads in obvious confusion, trying to stand up and call out as the blood gushed from their throats.""(14) Other sheep are loaded into the trunk of a car for later slaughtering at the buyer's home.  Wildlife ""Scapegoats""  Sheep aren't the only animals who suffer as a result of the wool industry. The Australian government permits the slaughter of approximately 5 million kangaroos a year because it views them as ""pests"" who eat grass ranchers want for their sheep and cows. Ninety percent of kangaroo killers are ""weekend"" hunters, killing by the most expedient methods available: running kangaroos down in trucks, poisoning their water, beating them to death, even impaling them on stakes and meat hooks and skinning them alive. The standard kangaroo hunting technique, as recounted by Paul and Anne Erlich in their book Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species , is to ""spotlight"" them from cars at night. ""The kangaroos would freeze in the light and were shot with rifles. Some were killed immediately, but some hunters purposely just wounded them--sometimes leaving them to suffer for hours or days so that their meat would remain fresh until they could be collected."" According to Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Humane Society of the U.S., joeys, or young kangaroos ""are not considered to be worth the cost of a bullet...and are often killed by being thrown against a tree or car bumper or kicked in the head.""  In the U.S., coyotes, vilified for allegedly preying on sheep and other livestock, are poisoned, shot and burned alive by the hundreds of thousands every year by ranchers and the U.S. government.  There are Alternatives  There are alternatives to wool clothes and blankets that the many people who are allergic to wool already use, including cotton, cotton flannel, polyester fleece, and other man-made fibers. These wash easily, don't shrink, keep their bright colors, cost less, and don't contribute to cruelty.
